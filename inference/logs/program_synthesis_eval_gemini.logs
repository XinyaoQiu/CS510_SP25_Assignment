As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Berland National Library has recently been built in the capital of Berland. In addition, in the library you can take any of the collected works of Berland leaders, the library has a reading room.Today was the pilot launch of an automated reading room visitors' accounting system! The scanner of the system is installed at the entrance to the reading room. It records the events of the form "reader entered room", "reader left room". Every reader is assigned a registration number during the registration procedure at the library — it's a unique integer from 1 to 106. Thus, the system logs events of two forms:  "+ ri" — the reader with registration number ri entered the room;  "- ri" — the reader with registration number ri left the room. The first launch of the system was a success, it functioned for some period of time, and, at the time of its launch and at the time of its shutdown, the reading room may already have visitors.Significant funds of the budget of Berland have been spent on the design and installation of the system. Therefore, some of the citizens of the capital now demand to explain the need for this system and the benefits that its implementation will bring. Now, the developers of the system need to urgently come up with reasons for its existence.Help the system developers to find the minimum possible capacity of the reading room (in visitors) using the log of the system available to you.
2. Input specification: The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of records in the system log. Next follow n events from the system journal in the order in which the were made. Each event was written on a single line and looks as "+ ri" or "- ri", where ri is an integer from 1 to 106, the registration number of the visitor (that is, distinct visitors always have distinct registration numbers). It is guaranteed that the log is not contradictory, that is, for every visitor the types of any of his two consecutive events are distinct. Before starting the system, and after stopping the room may possibly contain visitors.
3. Output specification: Print a single integer — the minimum possible capacity of the reading room.
4. Sample inputs: ['6\n+ 12001\n- 12001\n- 1\n- 1200\n+ 1\n+ 7', '2\n- 1\n- 2', '2\n+ 1\n- 1']
5. Sample outputs: ['3', '2', '1']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first sample test, the system log will ensure that at some point in the reading room were visitors with registration numbers 1, 1200 and 12001. More people were not in the room at the same time based on the log. Therefore, the answer to the test is 3.
7. Programming language: python

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: You are given a broken clock. You know, that it is supposed to show time in 12- or 24-hours HH:MM format. In 12-hours format hours change from 1 to 12, while in 24-hours it changes from 0 to 23. In both formats minutes change from 0 to 59.You are given a time in format HH:MM that is currently displayed on the broken clock. Your goal is to change minimum number of digits in order to make clocks display the correct time in the given format.For example, if 00:99 is displayed, it is enough to replace the second 9 with 3 in order to get 00:39 that is a correct time in 24-hours format. However, to make 00:99 correct in 12-hours format, one has to change at least two digits. Additionally to the first change one can replace the second 0 with 1 and obtain 01:39.
2. Input specification: The first line of the input contains one integer 12 or 24, that denote 12-hours or 24-hours format respectively. The second line contains the time in format HH:MM, that is currently displayed on the clock. First two characters stand for the hours, while next two show the minutes.
3. Output specification: The only line of the output should contain the time in format HH:MM that is a correct time in the given format. It should differ from the original in as few positions as possible. If there are many optimal solutions you can print any of them.
4. Sample inputs: ['24\n17:30', '12\n17:30', '24\n99:99']
5. Sample outputs: ['17:30', '07:30', '09:09']
6. Sample explanations: None
7. Programming language: python

1. Problem description: Little Chris knows there's no fun in playing dominoes, he thinks it's too random and doesn't require skill. Instead, he decided to play with the dominoes and make a "domino show".Chris arranges n dominoes in a line, placing each piece vertically upright. In the beginning, he simultaneously pushes some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right. However, somewhere between every two dominoes pushed in the same direction there is at least one domino pushed in the opposite direction.After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right. When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces. The figure shows one possible example of the process.  Given the initial directions Chris has pushed the dominoes, find the number of the dominoes left standing vertically at the end of the process!
2. Input specification: The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3000), the number of the dominoes in the line. The next line contains a character string s of length n. The i-th character of the string si is equal to    "L", if the i-th domino has been pushed to the left;  "R", if the i-th domino has been pushed to the right;  ".", if the i-th domino has not been pushed.  It is guaranteed that if si = sj = "L" and i &lt; j, then there exists such k that i &lt; k &lt; j and sk = "R"; if si = sj = "R" and i &lt; j, then there exists such k that i &lt; k &lt; j and sk = "L".
3. Output specification: Output a single integer, the number of the dominoes that remain vertical at the end of the process.
4. Sample inputs: ['14\n.L.R...LR..L..', '5\nR....', '1\n.']
5. Sample outputs: ['4', '0', '1']
6. Sample explanations: NoteThe first example case is shown on the figure. The four pieces that remain standing vertically are highlighted with orange.In the second example case, all pieces fall down since the first piece topples all the other pieces.In the last example case, a single piece has not been pushed in either direction.

1. Problem description: "Hey, it's homework time" — thought Polycarpus and of course he started with his favourite subject, IT. Polycarpus managed to solve all tasks but for the last one in 20 minutes. However, as he failed to solve the last task after some considerable time, the boy asked you to help him.The sequence of n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.You are given an arbitrary sequence a1, a2, ..., an containing n integers. Each integer is not less than 1 and not greater than 5000. Determine what minimum number of elements Polycarpus needs to change to get a permutation (he should not delete or add numbers). In a single change he can modify any single sequence element (i. e. replace it with another integer).
2. Input specification: The first line of the input data contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) which represents how many numbers are in the sequence. The second line contains a sequence of integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ i ≤ n).
3. Output specification: Print the only number — the minimum number of changes needed to get the permutation.
4. Sample inputs: ['3\n3 1 2', '2\n2 2', '5\n5 3 3 3 1']
5. Sample outputs: ['0', '1', '2']
6. Sample explanations: NoteThe first sample contains the permutation, which is why no replacements are required.In the second sample it is enough to replace the first element with the number 1 and that will make the sequence the needed permutation.In the third sample we can replace the second element with number 4 and the fourth element with number 2.

1. Problem description: Petya loves football very much, especially when his parents aren't home. Each morning he comes to the yard, gathers his friends and they play all day. From time to time they have a break to have some food or do some chores (for example, water the flowers).The key in football is to divide into teams fairly before the game begins. There are n boys playing football in the yard (including Petya), each boy's football playing skill is expressed with a non-negative characteristic ai (the larger it is, the better the boy plays). Let's denote the number of players in the first team as x, the number of players in the second team as y, the individual numbers of boys who play for the first team as pi and the individual numbers of boys who play for the second team as qi. Division n boys into two teams is considered fair if three conditions are fulfilled:  Each boy plays for exactly one team (x + y = n).  The sizes of teams differ in no more than one (|x - y| ≤ 1).  The total football playing skills for two teams differ in no more than by the value of skill the best player in the yard has. More formally: Your task is to help guys divide into two teams fairly. It is guaranteed that a fair division into two teams always exists.
2. Input specification: The first line contains the only integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105) which represents the number of guys in the yard. The next line contains n positive space-separated integers, ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 104), the i-th number represents the i-th boy's playing skills. 
3. Output specification: On the first line print an integer x — the number of boys playing for the first team. On the second line print x integers — the individual numbers of boys playing for the first team. On the third line print an integer y — the number of boys playing for the second team, on the fourth line print y integers — the individual numbers of boys playing for the second team. Don't forget that you should fulfil all three conditions: x + y = n, |x - y| ≤ 1, and the condition that limits the total skills. If there are multiple ways to solve the problem, print any of them. The boys are numbered starting from one in the order in which their skills are given in the input data. You are allowed to print individual numbers of boys who belong to the same team in any order.
4. Sample inputs: ['3\n1 2 1', '5\n2 3 3 1 1']
5. Sample outputs: ['2\n1 2 \n1\n3', '3\n4 1 3 \n2\n5 2']
6. Sample explanations: NoteLet's consider the first sample test. There we send the first and the second boy to the first team and the third boy to the second team. Let's check all three conditions of a fair division. The first limitation is fulfilled (all boys play), the second limitation on the sizes of groups (|2 - 1| = 1 ≤ 1) is fulfilled, the third limitation on the difference in skills ((2 + 1) - (1) = 2 ≤ 2) is fulfilled.

1. Problem description: One day little Vasya found mom's pocket book. The book had n names of her friends and unusually enough, each name was exactly m letters long. Let's number the names from 1 to n in the order in which they are written.As mom wasn't home, Vasya decided to play with names: he chose three integers i, j, k (1 ≤ i &lt; j ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ m), then he took names number i and j and swapped their prefixes of length k. For example, if we take names "CBDAD" and "AABRD" and swap their prefixes with the length of 3, the result will be names "AABAD" and "CBDRD".You wonder how many different names Vasya can write instead of name number 1, if Vasya is allowed to perform any number of the described actions. As Vasya performs each action, he chooses numbers i, j, k independently from the previous moves and his choice is based entirely on his will. The sought number can be very large, so you should only find it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).
2. Input specification: The first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of names and the length of each name, correspondingly. Then n lines contain names, each name consists of exactly m uppercase Latin letters.
3. Output specification: Print the single number — the number of different names that could end up in position number 1 in the pocket book after the applying the procedures described above. Print the number modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).
4. Sample inputs: ['2 3\nAAB\nBAA', '4 5\nABABA\nBCGDG\nAAAAA\nYABSA']
5. Sample outputs: ['4', '216']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first sample Vasya can get the following names in the position number 1: "AAB", "AAA", "BAA" and "BAB".

1. Problem description: An African crossword is a rectangular table n × m in size. Each cell of the table contains exactly one letter. This table (it is also referred to as grid) contains some encrypted word that needs to be decoded.To solve the crossword you should cross out all repeated letters in rows and columns. In other words, a letter should only be crossed out if and only if the corresponding column or row contains at least one more letter that is exactly the same. Besides, all such letters are crossed out simultaneously.When all repeated letters have been crossed out, we should write the remaining letters in a string. The letters that occupy a higher position follow before the letters that occupy a lower position. If the letters are located in one row, then the letter to the left goes first. The resulting word is the answer to the problem.You are suggested to solve an African crossword and print the word encrypted there.
2. Input specification: The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Next n lines contain m lowercase Latin letters each. That is the crossword grid.
3. Output specification: Print the encrypted word on a single line. It is guaranteed that the answer consists of at least one letter.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: A little boy Gerald entered a clothes shop and found out something very unpleasant: not all clothes turns out to match. For example, Gerald noticed that he looks rather ridiculous in a smoking suit and a baseball cap.Overall the shop sells n clothing items, and exactly m pairs of clothing items match. Each item has its price, represented by an integer number of rubles. Gerald wants to buy three clothing items so that they matched each other. Besides, he wants to spend as little money as possible. Find the least possible sum he can spend.
2. Input specification: The first input file line contains integers n and m — the total number of clothing items in the shop and the total number of matching pairs of clothing items (). Next line contains n integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 106) — the prices of the clothing items in rubles. Next m lines each contain a pair of space-separated integers ui and vi (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n, ui ≠ vi). Each such pair of numbers means that the ui-th and the vi-th clothing items match each other. It is guaranteed that in each pair ui and vi are distinct and all the unordered pairs (ui, vi) are different.
3. Output specification: Print the only number — the least possible sum in rubles that Gerald will have to pay in the shop. If the shop has no three clothing items that would match each other, print "-1" (without the quotes).
4. Sample inputs: ['3 3\n1 2 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1', '3 2\n2 3 4\n2 3\n2 1', '4 4\n1 1 1 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 1']
5. Sample outputs: ['6', '-1', '-1']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first test there only are three pieces of clothing and they all match each other. Thus, there is only one way — to buy the 3 pieces of clothing; in this case he spends 6 roubles.The second test only has three pieces of clothing as well, yet Gerald can't buy them because the first piece of clothing does not match the third one. Thus, there are no three matching pieces of clothing. The answer is -1.In the third example there are 4 pieces of clothing, but Gerald can't buy any 3 of them simultaneously. The answer is -1.

1. Problem description: Little Petya loves inequations. Help him find n positive integers a1, a2, ..., an, such that the following two conditions are satisfied: a12 + a22 + ... + an2 ≥ x a1 + a2 + ... + an ≤ y
2. Input specification: The first line contains three space-separated integers n, x and y (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ x ≤ 1012, 1 ≤ y ≤ 106). Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is recommended to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.
3. Output specification: Print n positive integers that satisfy the conditions, one integer per line. If such numbers do not exist, print a single number "-1". If there are several solutions, print any of them.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: When little Petya grew up and entered the university, he started to take part in АСМ contests. Later he realized that he doesn't like how the АСМ contests are organised: the team could only have three members (and he couldn't take all his friends to the competitions and distribute the tasks between the team members efficiently), so he decided to organize his own contests PFAST Inc. — Petr and Friends Are Solving Tasks Corporation. PFAST Inc. rules allow a team to have unlimited number of members.To make this format of contests popular he organised his own tournament. To create the team he will prepare for the contest organised by the PFAST Inc. rules, he chose several volunteers (up to 16 people) and decided to compile a team from them. Petya understands perfectly that if a team has two people that don't get on well, then the team will perform poorly. Put together a team with as many players as possible given that all players should get on well with each other.
2. Input specification: The first line contains two integer numbers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) — the number of volunteers, and m () — the number of pairs that do not get on. Next n lines contain the volunteers' names (each name is a non-empty string consisting of no more than 10 uppercase and/or lowercase Latin letters). Next m lines contain two names — the names of the volunteers who do not get on. The names in pair are separated with a single space. Each pair of volunteers who do not get on occurs exactly once. The strings are case-sensitive. All n names are distinct.
3. Output specification: The first output line should contain the single number k — the number of people in the sought team. Next k lines should contain the names of the sought team's participants in the lexicographical order. If there are several variants to solve the problem, print any of them. Petya might not be a member of the sought team.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Anna and Maria are in charge of the math club for junior students. When the club gathers together, the students behave badly. They've brought lots of shoe laces to the club and got tied with each other. Specifically, each string ties together two students. Besides, if two students are tied, then the lace connects the first student with the second one as well as the second student with the first one.To restore order, Anna and Maria do the following. First, for each student Anna finds out what other students he is tied to. If a student is tied to exactly one other student, Anna reprimands him. Then Maria gathers in a single group all the students who have been just reprimanded. She kicks them out from the club. This group of students immediately leaves the club. These students takes with them the laces that used to tie them. Then again for every student Anna finds out how many other students he is tied to and so on. And they do so until Anna can reprimand at least one student.Determine how many groups of students will be kicked out of the club.
2. Input specification: The first line contains two integers n and m — the initial number of students and laces (). The students are numbered from 1 to n, and the laces are numbered from 1 to m. Next m lines each contain two integers a and b — the numbers of students tied by the i-th lace (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b). It is guaranteed that no two students are tied with more than one lace. No lace ties a student to himself.
3. Output specification: Print the single number — the number of groups of students that will be kicked out from the club.
4. Sample inputs: ['3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1', '6 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4', '6 5\n1 4\n2 4\n3 4\n5 4\n6 4']
5. Sample outputs: ['0', '2', '1']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first sample Anna and Maria won't kick out any group of students — in the initial position every student is tied to two other students and Anna won't be able to reprimand anyone.In the second sample four students are tied in a chain and two more are running by themselves. First Anna and Maria kick out the two students from both ends of the chain (1 and 4), then — two other students from the chain (2 and 3). At that the students who are running by themselves will stay in the club.In the third sample Anna and Maria will momentarily kick out all students except for the fourth one and the process stops at that point. The correct answer is one.

1. Problem description: A group of n merry programmers celebrate Robert Floyd's birthday. Polucarpus has got an honourable task of pouring Ber-Cola to everybody. Pouring the same amount of Ber-Cola to everybody is really important. In other words, the drink's volume in each of the n mugs must be the same.Polycarpus has already began the process and he partially emptied the Ber-Cola bottle. Now the first mug has a1 milliliters of the drink, the second one has a2 milliliters and so on. The bottle has b milliliters left and Polycarpus plans to pour them into the mugs so that the main equation was fulfilled.Write a program that would determine what volume of the drink Polycarpus needs to add into each mug to ensure that the following two conditions were fulfilled simultaneously:   there were b milliliters poured in total. That is, the bottle need to be emptied;  after the process is over, the volumes of the drink in the mugs should be equal. 
2. Input specification: The first line contains a pair of integers n, b (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ b ≤ 100), where n is the total number of friends in the group and b is the current volume of drink in the bottle. The second line contains a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100), where ai is the current volume of drink in the i-th mug.
3. Output specification: Print a single number "-1" (without the quotes), if there is no solution. Otherwise, print n float numbers c1, c2, ..., cn, where ci is the volume of the drink to add in the i-th mug. Print the numbers with no less than 6 digits after the decimal point, print each ci on a single line. Polycarpus proved that if a solution exists then it is unique. Russian locale is installed by default on the testing computer. Make sure that your solution use the point to separate the integer part of a real number from the decimal, not a comma.
4. Sample inputs: ['5 50\n1 2 3 4 5', '2 2\n1 100']
5. Sample outputs: ['12.000000\n11.000000\n10.000000\n9.000000\n8.000000', '-1']

1. Problem description: Dwarfs have planted a very interesting plant, which is a triangle directed "upwards". This plant has an amusing feature. After one year a triangle plant directed "upwards" divides into four triangle plants: three of them will point "upwards" and one will point "downwards". After another year, each triangle plant divides into four triangle plants: three of them will be directed in the same direction as the parent plant, and one of them will be directed in the opposite direction. Then each year the process repeats. The figure below illustrates this process.  Help the dwarfs find out how many triangle plants that point "upwards" will be in n years.
2. Input specification: The first line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of full years when the plant grew. Please do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.
3. Output specification: Print a single integer — the remainder of dividing the number of plants that will point "upwards" in n years by 1000000007 (109 + 7).
4. Sample inputs: ['1', '2']
5. Sample outputs: ['3', '10']
6. Sample explanations: NoteThe first test sample corresponds to the second triangle on the figure in the statement. The second test sample corresponds to the third one.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: In Berland the opposition is going to arrange mass walking on the boulevard. The boulevard consists of n tiles that are lain in a row and are numbered from 1 to n from right to left. The opposition should start walking on the tile number 1 and the finish on the tile number n. During the walk it is allowed to move from right to left between adjacent tiles in a row, and jump over a tile. More formally, if you are standing on the tile number i (i &lt; n - 1), you can reach the tiles number i + 1 or the tile number i + 2 from it (if you stand on the tile number n - 1, you can only reach tile number n). We can assume that all the opposition movements occur instantaneously.In order to thwart an opposition rally, the Berland bloody regime organized the rain. The tiles on the boulevard are of poor quality and they are rapidly destroyed in the rain. We know that the i-th tile is destroyed after ai days of rain (on day ai tile isn't destroyed yet, and on day ai + 1 it is already destroyed). Of course, no one is allowed to walk on the destroyed tiles! So the walk of the opposition is considered thwarted, if either the tile number 1 is broken, or the tile number n is broken, or it is impossible to reach the tile number n from the tile number 1 if we can walk on undestroyed tiles.The opposition wants to gather more supporters for their walk. Therefore, the more time they have to pack, the better. Help the opposition to calculate how much time they still have and tell us for how many days the walk from the tile number 1 to the tile number n will be possible.
2. Input specification: The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 103) — the boulevard's length in tiles. The second line contains n space-separated integers ai — the number of days after which the i-th tile gets destroyed (1 ≤ ai ≤ 103). 
3. Output specification: Print a single number — the sought number of days.
4. Sample inputs: ['4\n10 3 5 10', '5\n10 2 8 3 5']
5. Sample outputs: ['5', '5']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first sample the second tile gets destroyed after day three, and the only path left is 1 → 3 → 4. After day five there is a two-tile gap between the first and the last tile, you can't jump over it.In the second sample path 1 → 3 → 5 is available up to day five, inclusive. On day six the last tile is destroyed and the walk is thwarted.

1. Problem description: The Little Elephant loves to play with color cards.He has n cards, each has exactly two colors (the color of the front side and the color of the back side). Initially, all the cards lay on the table with the front side up. In one move the Little Elephant can turn any card to the other side. The Little Elephant thinks that a set of cards on the table is funny if at least half of the cards have the same color (for each card the color of the upper side is considered).Help the Little Elephant to find the minimum number of moves needed to make the set of n cards funny.
2. Input specification: The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of the cards. The following n lines contain the description of all cards, one card per line. The cards are described by a pair of positive integers not exceeding 109 — colors of both sides. The first number in a line is the color of the front of the card, the second one — of the back. The color of the front of the card may coincide with the color of the back of the card. The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.
3. Output specification: On a single line print a single integer — the sought minimum number of moves. If it is impossible to make the set funny, print -1.
4. Sample inputs: ['3\n4 7\n4 7\n7 4', '5\n4 7\n7 4\n2 11\n9 7\n1 1']
5. Sample outputs: ['0', '2']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first sample there initially are three cards lying with colors 4, 4, 7. Since two of the three cards are of the same color 4, you do not need to change anything, so the answer is 0.In the second sample, you can turn the first and the fourth cards. After that three of the five cards will be of color 7.
7. Programming language: python
8. support programming language version: ['python2', 'python3']

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Vasya, like many others, likes to participate in a variety of sweepstakes and lotteries. Now he collects wrappings from a famous chocolate bar "Jupiter". According to the sweepstake rules, each wrapping has an integer written on it — the number of points that the participant adds to his score as he buys the bar. After a participant earns a certain number of points, he can come to the prize distribution center and exchange the points for prizes. When somebody takes a prize, the prize's cost is simply subtracted from the number of his points.Vasya didn't only bought the bars, he also kept a record of how many points each wrapping cost. Also, he remembers that he always stucks to the greedy strategy — as soon as he could take at least one prize, he went to the prize distribution centre and exchanged the points for prizes. Moreover, if he could choose between multiple prizes, he chose the most expensive one. If after an exchange Vasya had enough points left to get at least one more prize, then he continued to exchange points.The sweepstake has the following prizes (the prizes are sorted by increasing of their cost):   a mug (costs a points),  a towel (costs b points),  a bag (costs c points),  a bicycle (costs d points),  a car (costs e points). Now Vasya wants to recollect what prizes he has received. You know sequence p1, p2, ..., pn, where pi is the number of points Vasya got for the i-th bar. The sequence of points is given in the chronological order. You also know numbers a, b, c, d, e. Your task is to find, how many prizes Vasya received, what prizes they are and how many points he's got left after all operations are completed.
2. Input specification: The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of chocolate bar wrappings that brought points to Vasya. The second line contains space-separated integers p1, p2, ..., pn (1 ≤ pi ≤ 109). The third line contains 5 integers a, b, c, d, e (1 ≤ a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; d &lt; e ≤ 109) — the prizes' costs.
3. Output specification: Print on the first line 5 integers, separated by a space — the number of mugs, towels, bags, bicycles and cars that Vasya has got, respectively. On the second line print a single integer — the number of points Vasya will have left after all operations of exchange are completed. Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.
4. Sample inputs: ['3\n3 10 4\n2 4 10 15 20', '4\n10 4 39 2\n3 5 10 11 12']
5. Sample outputs: ['1 1 1 0 0 \n1', '3 0 1 0 3 \n0']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first sample Vasya gets 3 points after eating the first chocolate bar. Then he exchanges 2 points and gets a mug. Vasya wins a bag after eating the second chocolate bar. Then he wins a towel after eating the third chocolate bar. After all chocolate bars 3 - 2 + 10 - 10 + 4 - 4 = 1 points remains.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Vasya's bicycle chain drive consists of two parts: n stars are attached to the pedal axle, m stars are attached to the rear wheel axle. The chain helps to rotate the rear wheel by transmitting the pedal rotation.We know that the i-th star on the pedal axle has ai (0 &lt; a1 &lt; a2 &lt; ... &lt; an) teeth, and the j-th star on the rear wheel axle has bj (0 &lt; b1 &lt; b2 &lt; ... &lt; bm) teeth. Any pair (i, j) (1 ≤ i ≤ n; 1 ≤ j ≤ m) is called a gear and sets the indexes of stars to which the chain is currently attached. Gear (i, j) has a gear ratio, equal to the value .Since Vasya likes integers, he wants to find such gears (i, j), that their ratios are integers. On the other hand, Vasya likes fast driving, so among all "integer" gears (i, j) he wants to choose a gear with the maximum ratio. Help him to find the number of such gears.In the problem, fraction  denotes division in real numbers, that is, no rounding is performed.
2. Input specification: The first input line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of stars on the bicycle's pedal axle. The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 104) in the order of strict increasing. The third input line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 50) — the number of stars on the rear wheel axle. The fourth line contains m integers b1, b2, ..., bm (1 ≤ bi ≤ 104) in the order of strict increasing. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one gear (i, j), that its gear ratio is an integer. The numbers on the lines are separated by spaces.
3. Output specification: Print the number of "integer" gears with the maximum ratio among all "integer" gears.
4. Sample inputs: ['2\n4 5\n3\n12 13 15', '4\n1 2 3 4\n5\n10 11 12 13 14']
5. Sample outputs: ['2', '1']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first sample the maximum "integer" gear ratio equals 3. There are two gears that have such gear ratio. For one of them a1 = 4, b1 = 12, and for the other a2 = 5, b3 = 15.
7. Programming language: python
8. support programming language version: ['python2', 'python3']

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Bajtek is learning to skate on ice. He's a beginner, so his only mode of transportation is pushing off from a snow drift to the north, east, south or west and sliding until he lands in another snow drift. He has noticed that in this way it's impossible to get from some snow drifts to some other by any sequence of moves. He now wants to heap up some additional snow drifts, so that he can get from any snow drift to any other one. He asked you to find the minimal number of snow drifts that need to be created.We assume that Bajtek can only heap up snow drifts at integer coordinates.
2. Input specification: The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of snow drifts. Each of the following n lines contains two integers xi and yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000) — the coordinates of the i-th snow drift. Note that the north direction coinсides with the direction of Oy axis, so the east direction coinсides with the direction of the Ox axis. All snow drift's locations are distinct.
3. Output specification: Output the minimal number of snow drifts that need to be created in order for Bajtek to be able to reach any snow drift from any other one.
4. Sample inputs: ['2\n2 1\n1 2', '2\n2 1\n4 1']

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Peter likes to travel by train. He likes it so much that on the train he falls asleep. Once in summer Peter was going by train from city A to city B, and as usual, was sleeping. Then he woke up, started to look through the window and noticed that every railway station has a flag of a particular colour.The boy started to memorize the order of the flags' colours that he had seen. But soon he fell asleep again. Unfortunately, he didn't sleep long, he woke up and went on memorizing the colours. Then he fell asleep again, and that time he slept till the end of the journey.At the station he told his parents about what he was doing, and wrote two sequences of the colours that he had seen before and after his sleep, respectively.Peter's parents know that their son likes to fantasize. They give you the list of the flags' colours at the stations that the train passes sequentially on the way from A to B, and ask you to find out if Peter could see those sequences on the way from A to B, or from B to A. Remember, please, that Peter had two periods of wakefulness.Peter's parents put lowercase Latin letters for colours. The same letter stands for the same colour, different letters — for different colours.
2. Input specification: The input data contains three lines. The first line contains a non-empty string, whose length does not exceed 105, the string consists of lowercase Latin letters — the flags' colours at the stations on the way from A to B. On the way from B to A the train passes the same stations, but in reverse order.  The second line contains the sequence, written by Peter during the first period of wakefulness. The third line contains the sequence, written during the second period of wakefulness. Both sequences are non-empty, consist of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of each does not exceed 100 letters. Each of the sequences is written in chronological order. 
3. Output specification: Output one of the four words without inverted commas:    «forward» — if Peter could see such sequences only on the way from A to B;  «backward» — if Peter could see such sequences on the way from B to A;  «both» — if Peter could see such sequences both on the way from A to B, and on the way from B to A;  «fantasy» — if Peter could not see such sequences. 
4. Sample inputs: ['atob\na\nb', 'aaacaaa\naca\naa']
5. Sample outputs: ['forward', 'both']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIt is assumed that the train moves all the time, so one flag cannot be seen twice. There are no flags at stations A and B.

1. Problem description: And again a misfortune fell on Poor Student. He is being late for an exam.Having rushed to a bus stop that is in point (0, 0), he got on a minibus and they drove along a straight line, parallel to axis OX, in the direction of increasing x.Poor Student knows the following:   during one run the minibus makes n stops, the i-th stop is in point (xi, 0)  coordinates of all the stops are different  the minibus drives at a constant speed, equal to vb  it can be assumed the passengers get on and off the minibus at a bus stop momentarily  Student can get off the minibus only at a bus stop  Student will have to get off the minibus at a terminal stop, if he does not get off earlier  the University, where the exam will be held, is in point (xu, yu)  Student can run from a bus stop to the University at a constant speed vs as long as needed  a distance between two points can be calculated according to the following formula:   Student is already on the minibus, so, he cannot get off at the first bus stop Poor Student wants to get to the University as soon as possible. Help him to choose the bus stop, where he should get off. If such bus stops are multiple, choose the bus stop closest to the University.
2. Input specification: The first line contains three integer numbers: 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ vb, vs ≤ 1000. The second line contains n non-negative integers in ascending order: coordinates xi of the bus stop with index i. It is guaranteed that x1 equals to zero, and xn ≤ 105. The third line contains the coordinates of the University, integers xu and yu, not exceeding 105 in absolute value. 
3. Output specification: In the only line output the answer to the problem — index of the optimum bus stop.
4. Sample inputs: ['4 5 2\n0 2 4 6\n4 1', '2 1 1\n0 100000\n100000 100000']
5. Sample outputs: ['3', '2']
6. Sample explanations: NoteAs you know, students are a special sort of people, and minibuses usually do not hurry. That's why you should not be surprised, if Student's speed is higher than the speed of the minibus.

1. Problem description: A new cottage village called «Flatville» is being built in Flatland. By now they have already built in «Flatville» n square houses with the centres on the Оx-axis. The houses' sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. It's known that no two houses overlap, but they can touch each other.The architect bureau, where Peter works, was commissioned to build a new house in «Flatville». The customer wants his future house to be on the Оx-axis, to be square in shape, have a side t, and touch at least one of the already built houses. For sure, its sides should be parallel to the coordinate axes, its centre should be on the Ox-axis and it shouldn't overlap any of the houses in the village.Peter was given a list of all the houses in «Flatville». Would you help him find the amount of possible positions of the new house?
2. Input specification: The first line of the input data contains numbers n and t (1 ≤ n, t ≤ 1000). Then there follow n lines, each of them contains two space-separated integer numbers: xi ai, where xi — x-coordinate of the centre of the i-th house, and ai — length of its side ( - 1000 ≤ xi ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000).
3. Output specification: Output the amount of possible positions of the new house.
4. Sample inputs: ['2 2\n0 4\n6 2', '2 2\n0 4\n5 2', '2 3\n0 4\n5 2']

1. Problem description: A long time ago in some far country lived king Copa. After the recent king's reform, he got so large powers that started to keep the books by himself.The total income A of his kingdom during 0-th year is known, as well as the total income B during n-th year (these numbers can be negative — it means that there was a loss in the correspondent year). King wants to show financial stability. To do this, he needs to find common coefficient X — the coefficient of income growth during one year. This coefficient should satisfy the equation:A·Xn = B.Surely, the king is not going to do this job by himself, and demands you to find such number X.It is necessary to point out that the fractional numbers are not used in kingdom's economy. That's why all input numbers as well as coefficient X must be integers. The number X may be zero or negative.
2. Input specification: The input contains three integers A, B, n (|A|, |B| ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10).
3. Output specification: Output the required integer coefficient X, or «No solution», if such a coefficient does not exist or it is fractional. If there are several possible solutions, output any of them.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: In a strategic computer game "Settlers II" one has to build defense structures to expand and protect the territory. Let's take one of these buildings. At the moment the defense structure accommodates exactly n soldiers. Within this task we can assume that the number of soldiers in the defense structure won't either increase or decrease.Every soldier has a rank — some natural number from 1 to k. 1 stands for a private and k stands for a general. The higher the rank of the soldier is, the better he fights. Therefore, the player profits from having the soldiers of the highest possible rank.To increase the ranks of soldiers they need to train. But the soldiers won't train for free, and each training session requires one golden coin. On each training session all the n soldiers are present.At the end of each training session the soldiers' ranks increase as follows. First all the soldiers are divided into groups with the same rank, so that the least possible number of groups is formed. Then, within each of the groups where the soldiers below the rank k are present, exactly one soldier increases his rank by one.You know the ranks of all n soldiers at the moment. Determine the number of golden coins that are needed to increase the ranks of all the soldiers to the rank k.
2. Input specification: The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100). They represent the number of soldiers and the number of different ranks correspondingly. The second line contains n numbers in the non-decreasing order. The i-th of them, ai, represents the rank of the i-th soldier in the defense building (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ k).
3. Output specification: Print a single integer — the number of golden coins needed to raise all the soldiers to the maximal rank.
4. Sample inputs: ['4 4\n1 2 2 3', '4 3\n1 1 1 1']
5. Sample outputs: ['4', '5']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first example the ranks will be raised in the following manner:1 2 2 3  →  2 2 3 4  →  2 3 4 4  →  3 4 4 4  →  4 4 4 4Thus totals to 4 training sessions that require 4 golden coins.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Little Petya often travels to his grandmother in the countryside. The grandmother has a large garden, which can be represented as a rectangle 1 × n in size, when viewed from above. This rectangle is divided into n equal square sections. The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.Creating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1 × 5 rectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2. Then if we create an artificial rain over any of the sections with the height of 3, the water will flow over all the sections, except the ones with the height of 4. See the illustration of this example at the picture:  As Petya is keen on programming, he decided to find such a section that if we create artificial rain above it, the number of watered sections will be maximal. Help him. 
2. Input specification: The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000). The second line contains n positive integers which are the height of the sections. All the numbers are no less than 1 and not more than 1000.
3. Output specification: Print a single number, the maximal number of watered sections if we create artificial rain above exactly one section.

1. Problem description: n soldiers stand in a circle. For each soldier his height ai is known. A reconnaissance unit can be made of such two neighbouring soldiers, whose heights difference is minimal, i.e. |ai - aj| is minimal. So each of them will be less noticeable with the other. Output any pair of soldiers that can form a reconnaissance unit.
2. Input specification: The first line contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — amount of soldiers. Then follow the heights of the soldiers in their order in the circle — n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000). The soldier heights are given in clockwise or counterclockwise direction.
3. Output specification: Output two integers — indexes of neighbouring soldiers, who should form a reconnaissance unit. If there are many optimum solutions, output any of them. Remember, that the soldiers stand in a circle.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: The blinds are known to consist of opaque horizontal stripes that can be rotated thus regulating the amount of light flowing in the room. There are n blind stripes with the width of 1 in the factory warehouse for blind production. The problem is that all of them are spare details from different orders, that is, they may not have the same length (it is even possible for them to have different lengths)Every stripe can be cut into two or more parts. The cuttings are made perpendicularly to the side along which the length is measured. Thus the cuttings do not change the width of a stripe but each of the resulting pieces has a lesser length (the sum of which is equal to the length of the initial stripe)After all the cuttings the blinds are constructed through consecutive joining of several parts, similar in length, along sides, along which length is measured. Also, apart from the resulting pieces an initial stripe can be used as a blind if it hasn't been cut. It is forbidden to construct blinds in any other way.Thus, if the blinds consist of k pieces each d in length, then they are of form of a rectangle of k × d bourlemeters. Your task is to find for what window possessing the largest possible area the blinds can be made from the given stripes if on technical grounds it is forbidden to use pieces shorter than l bourlemeter. The window is of form of a rectangle with side lengths as positive integers.
2. Input specification: The first output line contains two space-separated integers n and l (1 ≤ n, l ≤ 100). They are the number of stripes in the warehouse and the minimal acceptable length of a blind stripe in bourlemeters. The second line contains space-separated n integers ai. They are the lengths of initial stripes in bourlemeters (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100).
3. Output specification: Print the single number — the maximal area of the window in square bourlemeters that can be completely covered. If no window with a positive area that can be covered completely without breaking any of the given rules exist, then print the single number 0.
4. Sample inputs: ['4 2\n1 2 3 4', '5 3\n5 5 7 3 1', '2 3\n1 2']
5. Sample outputs: ['8', '15', '0']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first sample test the required window is 2 × 4 in size and the blinds for it consist of 4 parts, each 2 bourlemeters long. One of the parts is the initial stripe with the length of 2, the other one is a part of a cut stripe with the length of 3 and the two remaining stripes are parts of a stripe with the length of 4 cut in halves.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Vasya decided to write an anonymous letter cutting the letters out of a newspaper heading. He knows heading s1 and text s2 that he wants to send. Vasya can use every single heading letter no more than once. Vasya doesn't have to cut the spaces out of the heading — he just leaves some blank space to mark them. Help him; find out if he will manage to compose the needed text.
2. Input specification: The first line contains a newspaper heading s1. The second line contains the letter text s2. s1 и s2 are non-empty lines consisting of spaces, uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, whose lengths do not exceed 200 symbols. The uppercase and lowercase letters should be differentiated. Vasya does not cut spaces out of the heading.
3. Output specification: If Vasya can write the given anonymous letter, print YES, otherwise print NO

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: A kindergarten teacher Natalia Pavlovna has invented a new ball game. This game not only develops the children's physique, but also teaches them how to count. The game goes as follows. Kids stand in circle. Let's agree to think of the children as numbered with numbers from 1 to n clockwise and the child number 1 is holding the ball. First the first child throws the ball to the next one clockwise, i.e. to the child number 2. Then the child number 2 throws the ball to the next but one child, i.e. to the child number 4, then the fourth child throws the ball to the child that stands two children away from him, i.e. to the child number 7, then the ball is thrown to the child who stands 3 children away from the child number 7, then the ball is thrown to the child who stands 4 children away from the last one, and so on. It should be mentioned that when a ball is thrown it may pass the beginning of the circle. For example, if n = 5, then after the third throw the child number 2 has the ball again. Overall, n - 1 throws are made, and the game ends.The problem is that not all the children get the ball during the game. If a child doesn't get the ball, he gets very upset and cries until Natalia Pavlovna gives him a candy. That's why Natalia Pavlovna asks you to help her to identify the numbers of the children who will get the ball after each throw.
2. Input specification: The first line contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) which indicates the number of kids in the circle.
3. Output specification: In the single line print n - 1 numbers which are the numbers of children who will get the ball after each throw. Separate the numbers by spaces.
4. Sample inputs: ['10', '3']
5. Sample outputs: ['2 4 7 1 6 2 9 7 6', '2 1']
6. Sample explanations: None
7. Programming language: python
8. support programming language version: ['python2', 'python3']

1. Problem description: Bob likes to draw camels: with a single hump, two humps, three humps, etc. He draws a camel by connecting points on a coordinate plane. Now he's drawing camels with t humps, representing them as polylines in the plane. Each polyline consists of n vertices with coordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2), ..., (xn,yn). The first vertex has a coordinate x1=1, the second — x2=2, etc. Coordinates yi might be any, but should satisfy the following conditions:  there should be t humps precisely, i.e. such indexes j (2≤j≤n-1), so that yj-1<yj>yj+1,  there should be precisely t-1 such indexes j (2≤j≤n-1), so that yj-1>yj<yj+1,  no segment of a polyline should be parallel to the Ox-axis,  all yi are integers between 1 and 4. For a series of his drawings of camels with t humps Bob wants to buy a notebook, but he doesn't know how many pages he will need. Output the amount of different polylines that can be drawn to represent camels with t humps for a given number n.
2. Input specification: The first line contains a pair of integers n and t (3≤n≤20, 1≤t≤10).

3. Output specification: Output the required amount of camels with t humps.

4. Sample inputs: ['6 1\n', '4 2\n']
5. Sample outputs: ['6\n', '0\n']

1. Problem description: Nick is attracted by everything unconventional. He doesn't like decimal number system any more, and he decided to study other number systems. A number system with base b caught his attention. Before he starts studying it, he wants to write in his notepad all the numbers of length n without leading zeros in this number system. Each page in Nick's notepad has enough space for c numbers exactly. Nick writes every suitable number only once, starting with the first clean page and leaving no clean spaces. Nick never writes number 0 as he has unpleasant memories about zero divide.Would you help Nick find out how many numbers will be written on the last page.
2. Input specification: The only input line contains three space-separated integers b, n and c (2≤b<10^10^6, 1≤n<10^10^6, 1≤c≤10^9). You may consider that Nick has infinite patience, endless amount of paper and representations of digits as characters. The numbers doesn't contain leading zeros.

3. Output specification: In the only line output the amount of numbers written on the same page as the last number.

4. Sample inputs: ['2 3 3\n', '2 3 4\n']
5. Sample outputs: ['1', '4']
6. Sample explanations: In both samples there are exactly 4 numbers of length 3 in binary number system. In the first sample Nick writes 3 numbers on the first page and 1 on the second page. In the second sample all the 4 numbers can be written on the first page.

1. Problem description: There are several days left before the fiftieth birthday of a famous Berland's writer Berlbury. In this connection the local library decided to make an exposition of the works of this famous science-fiction writer. It was decided as well that it is necessary to include into the exposition only those books that were published during a particular time period. It is obvious that if the books differ much in size, the visitors will not like it. That was why the organizers came to the opinion, that the difference between the highest and the lowest books in the exposition should be not more than k millimeters.The library has n volumes of books by Berlbury, arranged in chronological order of their appearance. The height of each book in millimeters is know, it is hi. As Berlbury is highly respected in the city, the organizers want to include into the exposition as many books as possible, and to find out what periods of his creative work they will manage to cover. You are asked to help the organizers cope with this hard task.
2. Input specification: The first line of the input data contains two integer numbers separated by a space n (1≤n≤10^5) and k (0≤k≤10^6) — the amount of books by Berlbury in the library, and the maximum allowed height difference between the lowest and the highest books. The second line contains n integer numbers separated by a space. Each number hi (1≤hi≤10^6) is the height of the i-th book in millimeters.

3. Output specification: In the first line of the output data print two numbers a and b (separate them by a space), where a is the maximum amount of books the organizers can include into the exposition, and b — the amount of the time periods, during which Berlbury published a books, and the height difference between the lowest and the highest among these books is not more than k milllimeters.
In each of the following b lines print two integer numbers separated by a space — indexes of the first and the last volumes from each of the required time periods of Berlbury's creative work.

4. Sample inputs: ['3 3\n14 12 10\n', '2 0\n10 10\n', '4 5\n8 19 10 13\n']
5. Sample outputs: ['2 2\n1 2\n2 3\n', '2 1\n1 2\n', '2 1\n3 4\n']
6. Sample explanations: None
7. Programming language: python
8. support programming language version: ['python2', 'python3']
Please take care to minimize the use of complex header files.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: All of us love treasures, right? That's why young Vasya is heading for a Treasure Island.Treasure Island may be represented as a rectangular table $$$n \times m$$$ which is surrounded by the ocean. Let us number rows of the field with consecutive integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from top to bottom and columns with consecutive integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ from left to right. Denote the cell in $$$r$$$-th row and $$$c$$$-th column as $$$(r, c)$$$. Some of the island cells contain impassable forests, and some cells are free and passable. Treasure is hidden in cell $$$(n, m)$$$.Vasya got off the ship in cell $$$(1, 1)$$$. Now he wants to reach the treasure. He is hurrying up, so he can move only from cell to the cell in next row (downwards) or next column (rightwards), i.e. from cell $$$(x, y)$$$ he can move only to cells $$$(x+1, y)$$$ and $$$(x, y+1)$$$. Of course Vasya can't move through cells with impassable forests.Evil Witch is aware of Vasya's journey and she is going to prevent him from reaching the treasure. Before Vasya's first move she is able to grow using her evil magic impassable forests in previously free cells. Witch is able to grow a forest in any number of any free cells except cells $$$(1, 1)$$$ where Vasya got off his ship and $$$(n, m)$$$ where the treasure is hidden.Help Evil Witch by finding out the minimum number of cells she has to turn into impassable forests so that Vasya is no longer able to reach the treasure.
2. Input specification: First line of input contains two positive integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$3 \le n \cdot m \le 1\,000\,000$$$), sizes of the island.
Following $$$n$$$ lines contains strings $$$s_i$$$ of length $$$m$$$ describing the island, $$$j$$$-th character of string $$$s_i$$$ equals "#" if cell $$$(i, j)$$$ contains an impassable forest and "." if the cell is free and passable. Let us remind you that Vasya gets of his ship at the cell $$$(1, 1)$$$, i.e. the first cell of the first row, and he wants to reach cell $$$(n, m)$$$, i.e. the last cell of the last row.
It's guaranteed, that cells $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(n, m)$$$ are empty.

3. Output specification: Print the only integer $$$k$$$, which is the minimum number of cells Evil Witch has to turn into impassable forest in order to prevent Vasya from reaching the treasure.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: The only difference between the easy and the hard versions is the maximum value of $$$k$$$.You are given an infinite sequence of form "112123123412345$$$\dots$$$" which consist of blocks of all consecutive positive integers written one after another. The first block consists of all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$1$$$, the second one — from $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$, the third one — from $$$1$$$ to $$$3$$$, $$$\dots$$$, the $$$i$$$-th block consists of all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$i$$$. So the first $$$56$$$ elements of the sequence are "11212312341234512345612345671234567812345678912345678910". Elements of the sequence are numbered from one. For example, the $$$1$$$-st element of the sequence is $$$1$$$, the $$$3$$$-rd element of the sequence is $$$2$$$, the $$$20$$$-th element of the sequence is $$$5$$$, the $$$38$$$-th element is $$$2$$$, the $$$56$$$-th element of the sequence is $$$0$$$.Your task is to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries. In the $$$i$$$-th query you are given one integer $$$k_i$$$. Calculate the digit at the position $$$k_i$$$ of the sequence.
2. Input specification: The first line of the input contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 500$$$) — the number of queries.
The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains one integer $$$k_i$$$ $$$(1 \le k_i \le 10^9)$$$ — the description of the corresponding query.

3. Output specification: Print $$$q$$$ lines. In the $$$i$$$-th line print one digit $$$x_i$$$ $$$(0 \le x_i \le 9)$$$ — the answer to the query $$$i$$$, i.e. $$$x_i$$$ should be equal to the element at the position $$$k_i$$$ of the sequence.

4. Sample inputs: []
5. Sample outputs: []
6. Sample explanations: None
7. Programming language: python
8. support programming language version: ['python2', 'python3']
Please take care to minimize the use of complex header files.

Respond should only with a string in the following JSON format:
[{"version": specific version used in the programming language, "target code": the code you produced in the respective programming language version."}]

Problem description: The only difference between the easy and the hard versions is the maximum value of $$$k$$$.You are given an infinite sequence of form "112123123412345$$$\dots$$$" which consist of blocks of all consecutive positive integers written one after another. The first block consists of all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$1$$$, the second one — from $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$, the third one — from $$$1$$$ to $$$3$$$, $$$\dots$$$, the $$$i$$$-th block consists of all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$i$$$. So the first $$$56$$$ elements of the sequence are "11212312341234512345612345671234567812345678912345678910". Elements of the sequence are numbered from one. For example, the $$$1$$$-st element of the sequence is $$$1$$$, the $$$3$$$-rd element of the sequence is $$$2$$$, the $$$20$$$-th element of the sequence is $$$5$$$, the $$$38$$$-th element is $$$2$$$, the $$$56$$$-th element of the sequence is $$$0$$$.Your task is to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries. In the $$$i$$$-th query you are given one integer $$$k_i$$$. Calculate the digit at the position $$$k_i$$$ of the sequence.
2. Input specification: The first line of the input contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 500$$$) — the number of queries.
The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains one integer $$$k_i$$$ $$$(1 \le k_i \le 10^{18})$$$ — the description of the corresponding query.

3. Output specification: Print $$$q$$$ lines. In the $$$i$$$-th line print one digit $$$x_i$$$ $$$(0 \le x_i \le 9)$$$ — the answer to the query $$$i$$$, i.e. $$$x_i$$$ should be equal to the element at the position $$$k_i$$$ of the sequence.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: You are given a directed graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ directed edges without self-loops or multiple edges.Let's denote the $$$k$$$-coloring of a digraph as following: you color each edge in one of $$$k$$$ colors. The $$$k$$$-coloring is good if and only if there no cycle formed by edges of same color.Find a good $$$k$$$-coloring of given digraph with minimum possible $$$k$$$.
2. Input specification: The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 5000$$$, $$$1 \le m \le 5000$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the digraph, respectively.
Next $$$m$$$ lines contain description of edges — one per line. Each edge is a pair of integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u, v \le n$$$, $$$u \ne v$$$) — there is directed edge from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ in the graph.
It is guaranteed that each ordered pair $$$(u, v)$$$ appears in the list of edges at most once.

3. Output specification: In the first line print single integer $$$k$$$ — the number of used colors in a good $$$k$$$-coloring of given graph.
In the second line print $$$m$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_m$$$ ($$$1 \le c_i \le k$$$), where $$$c_i$$$ is a color of the $$$i$$$-th edge (in order as they are given in the input).
If there are multiple answers print any of them (you still have to minimize $$$k$$$).

1. Problem description: You are given n segments on the Ox-axis. You can drive a nail in any integer point on the Ox-axis line nail so, that all segments containing this point, are considered nailed down. If the nail passes through endpoint of some segment, this segment is considered to be nailed too. What is the smallest number of nails needed to nail all the segments down?

1. Problem description: The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.Nauuo is a girl who loves random picture websites.One day she made a random picture website by herself which includes $$$n$$$ pictures.When Nauuo visits the website, she sees exactly one picture. The website does not display each picture with equal probability. The $$$i$$$-th picture has a non-negative weight $$$w_i$$$, and the probability of the $$$i$$$-th picture being displayed is $$$\frac{w_i}{\sum_{j=1}^nw_j}$$$. That is to say, the probability of a picture to be displayed is proportional to its weight.However, Nauuo discovered that some pictures she does not like were displayed too often. To solve this problem, she came up with a great idea: when she saw a picture she likes, she would add $$$1$$$ to its weight; otherwise, she would subtract $$$1$$$ from its weight.Nauuo will visit the website $$$m$$$ times. She wants to know the expected weight of each picture after all the $$$m$$$ visits modulo $$$998244353$$$. Can you help her?The expected weight of the $$$i$$$-th picture can be denoted by $$$\frac {q_i} {p_i}$$$ where $$$\gcd(p_i,q_i)=1$$$, you need to print an integer $$$r_i$$$ satisfying $$$0\le r_i&lt;998244353$$$ and $$$r_i\cdot p_i\equiv q_i\pmod{998244353}$$$. It can be proved that such $$$r_i$$$ exists and is unique.
2. Input specification: The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1\le m\le 3000$$$) — the number of pictures and the number of visits to the website. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$a_i$$$ is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$) — if $$$a_i=0$$$ , Nauuo does not like the $$$i$$$-th picture; otherwise Nauuo likes the $$$i$$$-th picture. It is guaranteed that there is at least one picture which Nauuo likes. The third line contains $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n$$$ ($$$w_i \geq 1$$$) — the initial weights of the pictures. It is guaranteed that the sum of all the initial weights does not exceed $$$998244352-m$$$.
3. Output specification: The output contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n$$$ — the expected weights modulo $$$998244353$$$.
4. Sample inputs: ['2 1\n0 1\n2 1', '1 2\n1\n1', '3 3\n0 1 1\n4 3 5']
5. Sample outputs: ['332748119\n332748119', '3', '160955686\n185138929\n974061117']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first example, if the only visit shows the first picture with a probability of $$$\frac 2 3$$$, the final weights are $$$(1,1)$$$; if the only visit shows the second picture with a probability of $$$\frac1 3$$$, the final weights are $$$(2,2)$$$.So, both expected weights are $$$\frac2 3\cdot 1+\frac 1 3\cdot 2=\frac4 3$$$ .Because $$$332748119\cdot 3\equiv 4\pmod{998244353}$$$, you need to print $$$332748119$$$ instead of $$$\frac4 3$$$ or $$$1.3333333333$$$.In the second example, there is only one picture which Nauuo likes, so every time Nauuo visits the website, $$$w_1$$$ will be increased by $$$1$$$.So, the expected weight is $$$1+2=3$$$.Nauuo is very naughty so she didn't give you any hint of the third example.

1. Problem description: Game "Minesweeper 1D" is played on a line of squares, the line's height is 1 square, the line's width is n squares. Some of the squares contain bombs. If a square doesn't contain a bomb, then it contains a number from 0 to 2 — the total number of bombs in adjacent squares.For example, the correct field to play looks like that: 001*2***101*. The cells that are marked with "*" contain bombs. Note that on the correct field the numbers represent the number of bombs in adjacent cells. For example, field 2* is not correct, because cell with value 2 must have two adjacent cells with bombs.Valera wants to make a correct field to play "Minesweeper 1D". He has already painted a squared field with width of n cells, put several bombs on the field and wrote numbers into some cells. Now he wonders how many ways to fill the remaining cells with bombs and numbers are there if we should get a correct field in the end.
2. Input specification: The first line contains sequence of characters without spaces s1s2... sn (1 ≤ n ≤ 106), containing only characters "*", "?" and digits "0", "1" or "2". If character si equals "*", then the i-th cell of the field contains a bomb. If character si equals "?", then Valera hasn't yet decided what to put in the i-th cell. Character si, that is equal to a digit, represents the digit written in the i-th square.
3. Output specification: Print a single integer — the number of ways Valera can fill the empty cells and get a correct field. As the answer can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).
4. Sample inputs: ['?01???', '?', '**12', '1']
5. Sample outputs: ['4', '2', '0', '0']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first test sample you can get the following correct fields: 001**1, 001***, 001*2*, 001*10.

1. Problem description: Andrey's favourite number is n. Andrey's friends gave him two identical numbers n as a New Year present. He hung them on a wall and watched them adoringly.Then Andrey got bored from looking at the same number and he started to swap digits first in one, then in the other number, then again in the first number and so on (arbitrary number of changes could be made in each number). At some point it turned out that if we sum the resulting numbers, then the number of zeroes with which the sum will end would be maximum among the possible variants of digit permutations in those numbers.Given number n, can you find the two digit permutations that have this property?
2. Input specification: The first line contains a positive integer n — the original number. The number of digits in this number does not exceed 105. The number is written without any leading zeroes.
3. Output specification: Print two permutations of digits of number n, such that the sum of these numbers ends with the maximum number of zeroes. The permutations can have leading zeroes (if they are present, they all should be printed). The permutations do not have to be different. If there are several answers, print any of them.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Little boy Gerald studies at school which is quite far from his house. That's why he has to go there by bus every day. The way from home to school is represented by a segment of a straight line; the segment contains exactly n + 1 bus stops. All of them are numbered with integers from 0 to n in the order in which they follow from Gerald's home. The bus stop by Gerald's home has number 0 and the bus stop by the school has number n.There are m buses running between the house and the school: the i-th bus goes from stop si to ti (si &lt; ti), visiting all the intermediate stops in the order in which they follow on the segment. Besides, Gerald's no idiot and he wouldn't get off the bus until it is still possible to ride on it closer to the school (obviously, getting off would be completely pointless). In other words, Gerald can get on the i-th bus on any stop numbered from si to ti - 1 inclusive, but he can get off the i-th bus only on the bus stop ti.Gerald can't walk between the bus stops and he also can't move in the direction from the school to the house.Gerald wants to know how many ways he has to get from home to school. Tell him this number. Two ways are considered different if Gerald crosses some segment between the stops on different buses. As the number of ways can be too much, find the remainder of a division of this number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).
2. Input specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers: n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 109, 0 ≤ m ≤ 105). Then follow m lines each containing two integers si, ti. They are the numbers of starting stops and end stops of the buses (0 ≤ si &lt; ti ≤ n).
3. Output specification: Print the only number — the number of ways to get to the school modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).
4. Sample inputs: ['2 2\n0 1\n1 2', '3 2\n0 1\n1 2', '5 5\n0 1\n0 2\n0 3\n0 4\n0 5']
5. Sample outputs: ['1', '0', '16']
6. Sample explanations: NoteThe first test has the only variant to get to school: first on bus number one to the bus stop number one; then on bus number two to the bus stop number two.In the second test no bus goes to the third bus stop, where the school is positioned. Thus, the correct answer is 0.In the third test Gerald can either get or not on any of the first four buses to get closer to the school. Thus, the correct answer is 24 = 16.

1. Problem description: As a German University in Cairo (GUC) student and a basketball player, Herr Wafa was delighted once he heard the news. GUC is finally participating in the Annual Basketball Competition (ABC). A team is to be formed of n players, all of which are GUC students. However, the team might have players belonging to different departments. There are m departments in GUC, numbered from 1 to m. Herr Wafa's department has number h. For each department i, Herr Wafa knows number si — how many students who play basketball belong to this department.Herr Wafa was also able to guarantee a spot on the team, using his special powers. But since he hates floating-point numbers, he needs your help at finding the probability that he will have at least one teammate belonging to his department. Note that every possible team containing Herr Wafa is equally probable. Consider all the students different from each other.
2. Input specification: The first line contains three integers n, m and h (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ h ≤ m) — the number of players on the team, the number of departments in GUC and Herr Wafa's department, correspondingly.  The second line contains a single-space-separated list of m integers si (1 ≤ si ≤ 100), denoting the number of students in the i-th department. Note that sh includes Herr Wafa.
3. Output specification: Print the probability that Herr Wafa will have at least one teammate from his department. If there is not enough basketball players in GUC to participate in ABC, print -1. The answer will be accepted if it has absolute or relative error not exceeding 10 - 6.
4. Sample inputs: ['3 2 1\n2 1', '3 2 1\n1 1', '3 2 1\n2 2']
5. Sample outputs: ['1', '-1', '0.666667']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first example all 3 players (2 from department 1 and 1 from department 2) must be chosen for the team. Both players from Wafa's departments will be chosen, so he's guaranteed to have a teammate from his department.In the second example, there are not enough players.In the third example, there are three possibilities to compose the team containing Herr Wafa. In two of them the other player from Herr Wafa's department is part of the team.

1. Problem description: There are several days left before the fiftieth birthday of a famous Berland's writer Berlbury. In this connection the local library decided to make an exposition of the works of this famous science-fiction writer. It was decided as well that it is necessary to include into the exposition only those books that were published during a particular time period. It is obvious that if the books differ much in size, the visitors will not like it. That was why the organizers came to the opinion, that the difference between the highest and the lowest books in the exposition should be not more than k millimeters.The library has n volumes of books by Berlbury, arranged in chronological order of their appearance. The height of each book in millimeters is know, it is hi. As Berlbury is highly respected in the city, the organizers want to include into the exposition as many books as possible, and to find out what periods of his creative work they will manage to cover. You are asked to help the organizers cope with this hard task.
2. Input specification: The first line of the input data contains two integer numbers separated by a space n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 106) — the amount of books by Berlbury in the library, and the maximum allowed height difference between the lowest and the highest books. The second line contains n integer numbers separated by a space. Each number hi (1 ≤ hi ≤ 106) is the height of the i-th book in millimeters.
3. Output specification: In the first line of the output data print two numbers a and b (separate them by a space), where a is the maximum amount of books the organizers can include into the exposition, and b — the amount of the time periods, during which Berlbury published a books, and the height difference between the lowest and the highest among these books is not more than k milllimeters. In each of the following b lines print two integer numbers separated by a space — indexes of the first and the last volumes from each of the required time periods of Berlbury's creative work.
4. Sample inputs: ['3 3\n14 12 10', '2 0\n10 10', '4 5\n8 19 10 13']

1. Problem description: Brothers Fred and George Weasley once got into the sporting goods store and opened a box of Quidditch balls. After long and painful experiments they found out that the Golden Snitch is not enchanted at all. It is simply a programmed device. It always moves along the same trajectory, which is a polyline with vertices at the points (x0, y0, z0), (x1, y1, z1), ..., (xn, yn, zn). At the beginning of the game the snitch is positioned at the point (x0, y0, z0), and then moves along the polyline at the constant speed vs. The twins have not yet found out how the snitch behaves then. Nevertheless, they hope that the retrieved information will help Harry Potter and his team in the upcoming match against Slytherin. Harry Potter learned that at the beginning the game he will be at the point (Px, Py, Pz) and his super fast Nimbus 2011 broom allows him to move at the constant speed vp in any direction or remain idle. vp is not less than the speed of the snitch vs. Harry Potter, of course, wants to catch the snitch as soon as possible. Or, if catching the snitch while it is moving along the polyline is impossible, he wants to hurry the Weasley brothers with their experiments. Harry Potter catches the snitch at the time when they are at the same point. Help Harry.
2. Input specification: The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000). The following n + 1 lines contain the coordinates xi, yi, zi, separated by single spaces. The coordinates of any two consecutive points do not coincide. The next line contains the velocities vp and vs, the last line contains Px, Py, Pz, separated by single spaces. All the numbers in the input are integers, their absolute value does not exceed 104. The speeds are strictly positive. It is guaranteed that vs ≤ vp.
3. Output specification: If Harry Potter can catch the snitch while it is moving along the polyline (including the end (xn, yn, zn)), print "YES" in the first line (without the quotes). Print in the second line t, which is the earliest moment of time, when Harry will be able to catch the snitch. On the third line print three numbers X, Y, Z, the coordinates of the point at which this happens. The absolute or relative error in the answer should not exceed 10 - 6. If Harry is not able to catch the snitch during its moving along the described polyline, print "NO".

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Professor Phunsuk Wangdu has performed some experiments on rays. The setup for n rays is as follows.There is a rectangular box having exactly n holes on the opposite faces. All rays enter from the holes of the first side and exit from the holes of the other side of the box. Exactly one ray can enter or exit from each hole. The holes are in a straight line.  Professor Wangdu is showing his experiment to his students. He shows that there are cases, when all the rays are intersected by every other ray. A curious student asked the professor: "Sir, there are some groups of rays such that all rays in that group intersect every other ray in that group. Can we determine the number of rays in the largest of such groups?".Professor Wangdu now is in trouble and knowing your intellect he asks you to help him.
2. Input specification: The first line contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106), the number of rays. The second line contains n distinct integers. The i-th integer xi (1 ≤ xi ≤ n) shows that the xi-th ray enters from the i-th hole. Similarly, third line contains n distinct integers. The i-th integer yi (1 ≤ yi ≤ n) shows that the yi-th ray exits from the i-th hole. All rays are numbered from 1 to n. 
3. Output specification: Output contains the only integer which is the number of rays in the largest group of rays all of which intersect each other.
4. Sample inputs: ['5\n1 4 5 2 3\n3 4 2 1 5', '3\n3 1 2\n2 3 1']
5. Sample outputs: ['3', '2']
6. Sample explanations: NoteFor the first test case, the figure is shown above. The output of the first test case is 3, since the rays number 1, 4 and 3 are the ones which are intersected by each other one i.e. 1 is intersected by 4 and 3, 3 is intersected by 4 and 1, and 4 is intersected by 1 and 3. Hence every ray in this group is intersected by each other one. There does not exist any group containing more than 3 rays satisfying the above-mentioned constraint.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Vasya’s elder brother Petya loves playing computer games. In one of his favourite computer games Petya reached the final level where a fight with the boss take place.While playing the game Petya found spell scrolls and now he is about to use them. Let’s describe the way fighting goes on this level:1) The boss has two parameters: max — the initial amount of health and reg — regeneration rate per second.2) Every scroll also has two parameters: powi — spell power measured in percents — the maximal amount of health counted off the initial one, which allows to use the scroll (i.e. if the boss has more than powi percent of health the scroll cannot be used); and dmgi the damage per second inflicted upon the boss if the scroll is used. As soon as a scroll is used it disappears and another spell is cast upon the boss that inflicts dmgi of damage per second upon him until the end of the game.During the battle the actions per second are performed in the following order: first the boss gets the damage from all the spells cast upon him, then he regenerates reg of health (at the same time he can’t have more than max of health), then the player may use another scroll (no more than one per second).The boss is considered to be defeated if at the end of a second he has nonpositive ( ≤ 0) amount of health.Help Petya to determine whether he can win with the set of scrolls available to him and if he can, determine the minimal number of seconds he needs to do it.
2. Input specification: The first line contains three integers N, max and reg (1 ≤ N, max, reg ≤ 1000) –– the amount of scrolls and the parameters of the boss. The next N lines contain two integers powi and dmgi each — the parameters of the i-th scroll (0 ≤ powi ≤ 100, 1 ≤ dmgi ≤ 2000). 
3. Output specification: In case Petya can’t complete this level, output in the single line NO. Otherwise, output on the first line YES. On the second line output the minimal time after which the boss can be defeated and the number of used scrolls. In the next lines for each used scroll output space-separated number of seconds passed from the start of the battle to the moment the scroll was used and the number of the scroll. Scrolls are numbered starting from 1 in the input order. The first scroll is considered to be available to be used after 0 seconds. Output scrolls in the order they were used. It is not allowed to use scrolls after the boss is defeated.
4. Sample inputs: ['2 10 3\n100 3\n99 1', '2 100 10\n100 11\n90 9']
5. Sample outputs: ['NO', 'YES\n19 2\n0 1\n10 2']
6. Sample explanations: None

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Berland scientists noticed long ago that the world around them depends on Berland population. Due to persistent research in this area the scientists managed to find out that the Berland chronology starts from the moment when the first two people came to that land (it is considered to have happened in the first year). After one Berland year after the start of the chronology the population had already equaled 13 people (the second year). However, tracing the population number during the following years was an ultimately difficult task, still it was found out that if di — the number of people in Berland in the year of i, then either di = 12di - 2, or di = 13di - 1 - 12di - 2. Of course no one knows how many people are living in Berland at the moment, but now we can tell if there could possibly be a year in which the country population equaled A. That's what we ask you to determine. Also, if possible, you have to find out in which years it could be (from the beginning of Berland chronology). Let's suppose that it could be in the years of a1, a2, ..., ak. Then you have to define how many residents could be in the country during those years apart from the A variant. Look at the examples for further explanation.
2. Input specification: The first line contains integer A (1 ≤ A &lt; 10300). It is guaranteed that the number doesn't contain leading zeros.
3. Output specification: On the first output line print YES, if there could be a year in which the total population of the country equaled A, otherwise print NO.  If the answer is YES, then you also have to print number k — the number of years in which the population could equal A. On the next line you have to output precisely k space-separated numbers — a1, a2, ..., ak. Those numbers have to be output in the increasing order. On the next line you should output number p — how many variants of the number of people could be in the years of a1, a2, ..., ak, apart from the A variant. On each of the next p lines you have to print one number — the sought number of residents. Those number also have to go in the increasing order.  If any number (or both of them) k or p exceeds 1000, then you have to print 1000 instead of it and only the first 1000 possible answers in the increasing order. The numbers should have no leading zeros.
4. Sample inputs: ['2', '3', '13', '1729']
5. Sample outputs: ['YES\n1\n1\n0', 'NO', 'YES\n1\n2\n0', 'YES\n1\n4\n1\n156']
6. Sample explanations: None
7. Programming language: python

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Vasya tries to break in a safe. He knows that a code consists of n numbers, and every number is a 0 or a 1. Vasya has made m attempts to enter the code. After each attempt the system told him in how many position stand the right numbers. It is not said in which positions the wrong numbers stand. Vasya has been so unlucky that he hasn’t entered the code where would be more than 5 correct numbers. Now Vasya is completely bewildered: he thinks there’s a mistake in the system and it is self-contradictory. Help Vasya — calculate how many possible code variants are left that do not contradict the previous system responses.
2. Input specification: The first input line contains two integers n and m (6 ≤ n ≤ 35, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10) which represent the number of numbers in the code and the number of attempts made by Vasya. Then follow m lines, each containing space-separated si and ci which correspondingly indicate Vasya’s attempt (a line containing n numbers which are 0 or 1) and the system’s response (an integer from 0 to 5 inclusively).
3. Output specification: Print the single number which indicates how many possible code variants that do not contradict the m system responses are left.
4. Sample inputs: ['6 2\n000000 2\n010100 4', '6 3\n000000 2\n010100 4\n111100 0', '6 3\n000000 2\n010100 4\n111100 2']
5. Sample outputs: ['6', '0', '1']
6. Sample explanations: None
7. Programming language: python
8. support programming language version: ['python2', 'python3']

1. Problem description: In the town of Aalam-Aara (meaning the Light of the Earth), previously there was no crime, no criminals but as the time progressed, sins started creeping into the hearts of once righteous people. Seeking solution to the problem, some of the elders found that as long as the corrupted part of population was kept away from the uncorrupted part, the crimes could be stopped. So, they are trying to set up a compound where they can keep the corrupted people. To ensure that the criminals don't escape the compound, a watchtower needs to be set up, so that they can be watched.Since the people of Aalam-Aara aren't very rich, they met up with a merchant from some rich town who agreed to sell them a land-plot which has already a straight line fence AB along which a few points are set up where they can put up a watchtower. Your task is to help them find out the number of points on that fence where the tower can be put up, so that all the criminals can be watched from there. Only one watchtower can be set up. A criminal is watchable from the watchtower if the line of visibility from the watchtower to him doesn't cross the plot-edges at any point between him and the tower i.e. as shown in figure 1 below, points X, Y, C and A are visible from point B but the points E and D are not.    Figure 1     Figure 2 Assume that the land plot is in the shape of a polygon and coordinate axes have been setup such that the fence AB is parallel to x-axis and the points where the watchtower can be set up are the integer points on the line. For example, in given figure 2, watchtower can be setup on any of five integer points on AB i.e. (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8) or (8, 8). You can assume that no three consecutive points are collinear and all the corner points other than A and B, lie towards same side of fence AB. The given polygon doesn't contain self-intersections.
2. Input specification: The first line of the test case will consist of the number of vertices n (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000). Next n lines will contain the coordinates of the vertices in the clockwise order of the polygon. On the i-th line are integers xi and yi (0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 106) separated by a space. The endpoints of the fence AB are the first two points, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
3. Output specification: Output consists of a single line containing the number of points where the watchtower can be set up.
4. Sample inputs: ['5\n4 8\n8 8\n9 4\n4 0\n0 4', '5\n4 8\n5 8\n5 4\n7 4\n2 2']
5. Sample outputs: ['5', '0']
6. Sample explanations: NoteFigure 2 shows the first test case. All the points in the figure are watchable from any point on fence AB. Since, AB has 5 integer coordinates, so answer is 5.For case two, fence CD and DE are not completely visible, thus answer is 0.

1. Problem description: Every year a race takes place on the motorway between cities A and B. This year Vanya decided to take part in the race and drive his own car that has been around and bears its own noble name — The Huff-puffer.So, Vasya leaves city A on the Huff-puffer, besides, at the very beginning he fills the petrol tank with α liters of petrol (α ≥ 10 is Vanya's favorite number, it is not necessarily integer). Petrol stations are located on the motorway at an interval of 100 kilometers, i.e. the first station is located 100 kilometers away from the city A, the second one is 200 kilometers away from the city A, the third one is 300 kilometers away from the city A and so on. The Huff-puffer spends 10 liters of petrol every 100 kilometers. Vanya checks the petrol tank every time he passes by a petrol station. If the petrol left in the tank is not enough to get to the next station, Vanya fills the tank with α liters of petrol. Otherwise, he doesn't stop at the station and drives on. For example, if α = 43.21, then the car will be fuelled up for the first time at the station number 4, when there'll be 3.21 petrol liters left. After the fuelling up the car will have 46.42 liters. Then Vanya stops at the station number 8 and ends up with 6.42 + 43.21 = 49.63 liters. The next stop is at the station number 12, 9.63 + 43.21 = 52.84. The next stop is at the station number 17 and so on. You won't believe this but the Huff-puffer has been leading in the race! Perhaps it is due to unexpected snow. Perhaps it is due to video cameras that have been installed along the motorway which register speed limit breaking. Perhaps it is due to the fact that Vanya threatened to junk the Huff-puffer unless the car wins. Whatever the reason is, the Huff-puffer is leading, and jealous people together with other contestants wrack their brains trying to think of a way to stop that outrage.One way to do this is to mine the next petrol station where Vanya will stop. Your task is to calculate at which station this will happen and warn Vanya. You don't know the α number, however, you are given the succession of the numbers of the stations where Vanya has stopped. Find the number of the station where the next stop will be.
2. Input specification: The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) which represents the number of petrol stations where Vanya has stopped. The next line has n space-separated integers which represent the numbers of the stations. The numbers are positive and do not exceed 106, they are given in the increasing order. No two numbers in the succession match. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one number α ≥ 10, to which such a succession of stops corresponds.
3. Output specification: Print in the first line "unique" (without quotes) if the answer can be determined uniquely. In the second line print the number of the station where the next stop will take place. If the answer is not unique, print in the first line "not unique".
4. Sample inputs: ['3\n1 2 4', '2\n1 2']
5. Sample outputs: ['unique\n5', 'not unique']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the second example the answer is not unique. For example, if α = 10, we'll have such a sequence as 1, 2, 3, and if α = 14, the sequence will be 1, 2, 4.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: You already know that Valery's favorite sport is biathlon. Due to your help, he learned to shoot without missing, and his skills are unmatched at the shooting range. But now a smaller task is to be performed, he should learn to complete the path fastest.The track's map is represented by a rectangle n × m in size divided into squares. Each square is marked with a lowercase Latin letter (which means the type of the plot), with the exception of the starting square (it is marked with a capital Latin letters S) and the terminating square (it is marked with a capital Latin letter T). The time of movement from one square to another is equal to 1 minute. The time of movement within the cell can be neglected. We can move from the cell only to side-adjacent ones, but it is forbidden to go beyond the map edges. Also the following restriction is imposed on the path: it is not allowed to visit more than k different types of squares (squares of one type can be visited an infinite number of times). Squares marked with S and T have no type, so they are not counted. But S must be visited exactly once — at the very beginning, and T must be visited exactly once — at the very end.Your task is to find the path from the square S to the square T that takes minimum time. Among all shortest paths you should choose the lexicographically minimal one. When comparing paths you should lexicographically represent them as a sequence of characters, that is, of plot types.
2. Input specification: The first input line contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50, n·m ≥ 2, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4). Then n lines contain the map. Each line has the length of exactly m characters and consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters S and T. It is guaranteed that the map contains exactly one character S and exactly one character T. Pretest 12 is one of the maximal tests for this problem.
3. Output specification: If there is a path that satisfies the condition, print it as a sequence of letters — the plot types. Otherwise, print "-1" (without quotes). You shouldn't print the character S in the beginning and T in the end. Note that this sequence may be empty. This case is present in pretests. You can just print nothing or print one "End of line"-character. Both will be accepted.
4. Sample inputs: ['5 3 2\nSba\nccc\naac\nccc\nabT', '3 4 1\nSxyy\nyxxx\nyyyT', '1 3 3\nTyS', '1 4 1\nSxyT']
5. Sample outputs: ['bcccc', 'xxxx', 'y', '-1']
6. Sample explanations: None

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Everyone knows that long ago on the territory of present-day Berland there lived Bindian tribes. Their capital was surrounded by n hills, forming a circle. On each hill there was a watchman, who watched the neighbourhood day and night.In case of any danger the watchman could make a fire on the hill. One watchman could see the signal of another watchman, if on the circle arc connecting the two hills there was no hill higher than any of the two. As for any two hills there are two different circle arcs connecting them, the signal was seen if the above mentioned condition was satisfied on at least one of the arcs. For example, for any two neighbouring watchmen it is true that the signal of one will be seen by the other.An important characteristics of this watch system was the amount of pairs of watchmen able to see each other's signals. You are to find this amount by the given heights of the hills.
2. Input specification: The first line of the input data contains an integer number n (3≤n≤10^6), n — the amount of hills around the capital. The second line contains n numbers — heights of the hills in clockwise order. All height numbers are integer and lie between 1 and 10^9.

3. Output specification: Print the required amount of pairs.

4. Sample inputs: ['5\n1 2 4 5 3\n']
5. Sample outputs: ['7\n']
6. Sample explanations: None
7. Programming language: python
8. support programming language version: ['python2', 'python3']
Please take care to minimize the use of complex header files.

Respond should only with a string in the following JSON format:
[{"version": specific version used in the programming language, "target code": the code you produced in the respective programming language version."}]
