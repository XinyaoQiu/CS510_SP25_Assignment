As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Berland National Library has recently been built in the capital of Berland. In addition, in the library you can take any of the collected works of Berland leaders, the library has a reading room.Today was the pilot launch of an automated reading room visitors' accounting system! The scanner of the system is installed at the entrance to the reading room. It records the events of the form "reader entered room", "reader left room". Every reader is assigned a registration number during the registration procedure at the library — it's a unique integer from 1 to 106. Thus, the system logs events of two forms:  "+ ri" — the reader with registration number ri entered the room;  "- ri" — the reader with registration number ri left the room. The first launch of the system was a success, it functioned for some period of time, and, at the time of its launch and at the time of its shutdown, the reading room may already have visitors.Significant funds of the budget of Berland have been spent on the design and installation of the system. Therefore, some of the citizens of the capital now demand to explain the need for this system and the benefits that its implementation will bring. Now, the developers of the system need to urgently come up with reasons for its existence.Help the system developers to find the minimum possible capacity of the reading room (in visitors) using the log of the system available to you.
2. Input specification: The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of records in the system log. Next follow n events from the system journal in the order in which the were made. Each event was written on a single line and looks as "+ ri" or "- ri", where ri is an integer from 1 to 106, the registration number of the visitor (that is, distinct visitors always have distinct registration numbers). It is guaranteed that the log is not contradictory, that is, for every visitor the types of any of his two consecutive events are distinct. Before starting the system, and after stopping the room may possibly contain visitors.
3. Output specification: Print a single integer — the minimum possible capacity of the reading room.
4. Sample inputs: ['6\n+ 12001\n- 12001\n- 1\n- 1200\n+ 1\n+ 7', '2\n- 1\n- 2', '2\n+ 1\n- 1']
5. Sample outputs: ['3', '2', '1']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first sample test, the system log will ensure that at some point in the reading room were visitors with registration numbers 1, 1200 and 12001. More people were not in the room at the same time based on the log. Therefore, the answer to the test is 3.

1. Problem description: You are given a broken clock. You know, that it is supposed to show time in 12- or 24-hours HH:MM format. In 12-hours format hours change from 1 to 12, while in 24-hours it changes from 0 to 23. In both formats minutes change from 0 to 59.You are given a time in format HH:MM that is currently displayed on the broken clock. Your goal is to change minimum number of digits in order to make clocks display the correct time in the given format.For example, if 00:99 is displayed, it is enough to replace the second 9 with 3 in order to get 00:39 that is a correct time in 24-hours format. However, to make 00:99 correct in 12-hours format, one has to change at least two digits. Additionally to the first change one can replace the second 0 with 1 and obtain 01:39.
2. Input specification: The first line of the input contains one integer 12 or 24, that denote 12-hours or 24-hours format respectively. The second line contains the time in format HH:MM, that is currently displayed on the clock. First two characters stand for the hours, while next two show the minutes.
3. Output specification: The only line of the output should contain the time in format HH:MM that is a correct time in the given format. It should differ from the original in as few positions as possible. If there are many optimal solutions you can print any of them.
4. Sample inputs: ['24\n17:30', '12\n17:30', '24\n99:99']
5. Sample outputs: ['17:30', '07:30', '09:09']

1. Problem description: Little Chris knows there's no fun in playing dominoes, he thinks it's too random and doesn't require skill. Instead, he decided to play with the dominoes and make a "domino show".Chris arranges n dominoes in a line, placing each piece vertically upright. In the beginning, he simultaneously pushes some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right. However, somewhere between every two dominoes pushed in the same direction there is at least one domino pushed in the opposite direction.After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right. When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces. The figure shows one possible example of the process.  Given the initial directions Chris has pushed the dominoes, find the number of the dominoes left standing vertically at the end of the process!
2. Input specification: The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3000), the number of the dominoes in the line. The next line contains a character string s of length n. The i-th character of the string si is equal to    "L", if the i-th domino has been pushed to the left;  "R", if the i-th domino has been pushed to the right;  ".", if the i-th domino has not been pushed.  It is guaranteed that if si = sj = "L" and i &lt; j, then there exists such k that i &lt; k &lt; j and sk = "R"; if si = sj = "R" and i &lt; j, then there exists such k that i &lt; k &lt; j and sk = "L".
3. Output specification: Output a single integer, the number of the dominoes that remain vertical at the end of the process.
4. Sample inputs: ['14\n.L.R...LR..L..', '5\nR....', '1\n.']
5. Sample outputs: ['4', '0', '1']
6. Sample explanations: NoteThe first example case is shown on the figure. The four pieces that remain standing vertically are highlighted with orange.In the second example case, all pieces fall down since the first piece topples all the other pieces.In the last example case, a single piece has not been pushed in either direction.

1. Problem description: "Hey, it's homework time" — thought Polycarpus and of course he started with his favourite subject, IT. Polycarpus managed to solve all tasks but for the last one in 20 minutes. However, as he failed to solve the last task after some considerable time, the boy asked you to help him.The sequence of n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.You are given an arbitrary sequence a1, a2, ..., an containing n integers. Each integer is not less than 1 and not greater than 5000. Determine what minimum number of elements Polycarpus needs to change to get a permutation (he should not delete or add numbers). In a single change he can modify any single sequence element (i. e. replace it with another integer).
2. Input specification: The first line of the input data contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) which represents how many numbers are in the sequence. The second line contains a sequence of integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ i ≤ n).
3. Output specification: Print the only number — the minimum number of changes needed to get the permutation.
4. Sample inputs: ['3\n3 1 2', '2\n2 2', '5\n5 3 3 3 1']
5. Sample outputs: ['0', '1', '2']
6. Sample explanations: NoteThe first sample contains the permutation, which is why no replacements are required.In the second sample it is enough to replace the first element with the number 1 and that will make the sequence the needed permutation.In the third sample we can replace the second element with number 4 and the fourth element with number 2.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Petya loves football very much, especially when his parents aren't home. Each morning he comes to the yard, gathers his friends and they play all day. From time to time they have a break to have some food or do some chores (for example, water the flowers).The key in football is to divide into teams fairly before the game begins. There are n boys playing football in the yard (including Petya), each boy's football playing skill is expressed with a non-negative characteristic ai (the larger it is, the better the boy plays). Let's denote the number of players in the first team as x, the number of players in the second team as y, the individual numbers of boys who play for the first team as pi and the individual numbers of boys who play for the second team as qi. Division n boys into two teams is considered fair if three conditions are fulfilled:  Each boy plays for exactly one team (x + y = n).  The sizes of teams differ in no more than one (|x - y| ≤ 1).  The total football playing skills for two teams differ in no more than by the value of skill the best player in the yard has. More formally: Your task is to help guys divide into two teams fairly. It is guaranteed that a fair division into two teams always exists.
2. Input specification: The first line contains the only integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105) which represents the number of guys in the yard. The next line contains n positive space-separated integers, ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 104), the i-th number represents the i-th boy's playing skills. 
3. Output specification: On the first line print an integer x — the number of boys playing for the first team. On the second line print x integers — the individual numbers of boys playing for the first team. On the third line print an integer y — the number of boys playing for the second team, on the fourth line print y integers — the individual numbers of boys playing for the second team. Don't forget that you should fulfil all three conditions: x + y = n, |x - y| ≤ 1, and the condition that limits the total skills. If there are multiple ways to solve the problem, print any of them. The boys are numbered starting from one in the order in which their skills are given in the input data. You are allowed to print individual numbers of boys who belong to the same team in any order.
4. Sample inputs: ['3\n1 2 1', '5\n2 3 3 1 1']
5. Sample outputs: ['2\n1 2 \n1\n3', '3\n4 1 3 \n2\n5 2']
6. Sample explanations: NoteLet's consider the first sample test. There we send the first and the second boy to the first team and the third boy to the second team. Let's check all three conditions of a fair division. The first limitation is fulfilled (all boys play), the second limitation on the sizes of groups (|2 - 1| = 1 ≤ 1) is fulfilled, the third limitation on the difference in skills ((2 + 1) - (1) = 2 ≤ 2) is fulfilled.

1. Problem description: One day little Vasya found mom's pocket book. The book had n names of her friends and unusually enough, each name was exactly m letters long. Let's number the names from 1 to n in the order in which they are written.As mom wasn't home, Vasya decided to play with names: he chose three integers i, j, k (1 ≤ i &lt; j ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ m), then he took names number i and j and swapped their prefixes of length k. For example, if we take names "CBDAD" and "AABRD" and swap their prefixes with the length of 3, the result will be names "AABAD" and "CBDRD".You wonder how many different names Vasya can write instead of name number 1, if Vasya is allowed to perform any number of the described actions. As Vasya performs each action, he chooses numbers i, j, k independently from the previous moves and his choice is based entirely on his will. The sought number can be very large, so you should only find it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).
2. Input specification: The first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of names and the length of each name, correspondingly. Then n lines contain names, each name consists of exactly m uppercase Latin letters.
3. Output specification: Print the single number — the number of different names that could end up in position number 1 in the pocket book after the applying the procedures described above. Print the number modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: An African crossword is a rectangular table n × m in size. Each cell of the table contains exactly one letter. This table (it is also referred to as grid) contains some encrypted word that needs to be decoded.To solve the crossword you should cross out all repeated letters in rows and columns. In other words, a letter should only be crossed out if and only if the corresponding column or row contains at least one more letter that is exactly the same. Besides, all such letters are crossed out simultaneously.When all repeated letters have been crossed out, we should write the remaining letters in a string. The letters that occupy a higher position follow before the letters that occupy a lower position. If the letters are located in one row, then the letter to the left goes first. The resulting word is the answer to the problem.You are suggested to solve an African crossword and print the word encrypted there.
2. Input specification: The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Next n lines contain m lowercase Latin letters each. That is the crossword grid.
3. Output specification: Print the encrypted word on a single line. It is guaranteed that the answer consists of at least one letter.
4. Sample inputs: ['3 3\ncba\nbcd\ncbc', '5 5\nfcofd\nooedo\nafaoa\nrdcdf\neofsf']
5. Sample outputs: ['abcd', 'codeforces']
6. Sample explanations: None

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: A little boy Gerald entered a clothes shop and found out something very unpleasant: not all clothes turns out to match. For example, Gerald noticed that he looks rather ridiculous in a smoking suit and a baseball cap.Overall the shop sells n clothing items, and exactly m pairs of clothing items match. Each item has its price, represented by an integer number of rubles. Gerald wants to buy three clothing items so that they matched each other. Besides, he wants to spend as little money as possible. Find the least possible sum he can spend.
2. Input specification: The first input file line contains integers n and m — the total number of clothing items in the shop and the total number of matching pairs of clothing items (). Next line contains n integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 106) — the prices of the clothing items in rubles. Next m lines each contain a pair of space-separated integers ui and vi (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n, ui ≠ vi). Each such pair of numbers means that the ui-th and the vi-th clothing items match each other. It is guaranteed that in each pair ui and vi are distinct and all the unordered pairs (ui, vi) are different.
3. Output specification: Print the only number — the least possible sum in rubles that Gerald will have to pay in the shop. If the shop has no three clothing items that would match each other, print "-1" (without the quotes).
4. Sample inputs: ['3 3\n1 2 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1', '3 2\n2 3 4\n2 3\n2 1', '4 4\n1 1 1 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 1']
5. Sample outputs: ['6', '-1', '-1']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first test there only are three pieces of clothing and they all match each other. Thus, there is only one way — to buy the 3 pieces of clothing; in this case he spends 6 roubles.The second test only has three pieces of clothing as well, yet Gerald can't buy them because the first piece of clothing does not match the third one. Thus, there are no three matching pieces of clothing. The answer is -1.In the third example there are 4 pieces of clothing, but Gerald can't buy any 3 of them simultaneously. The answer is -1.
7. Programming language: python
8. support programming language version: ['python2', 'python3']

2. Input specification: The first line contains three space-separated integers n, x and y (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ x ≤ 1012, 1 ≤ y ≤ 106). Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is recommended to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.
3. Output specification: Print n positive integers that satisfy the conditions, one integer per line. If such numbers do not exist, print a single number "-1". If there are several solutions, print any of them.
4. Sample inputs: ['5 15 15', '2 3 2', '1 99 11']

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: When little Petya grew up and entered the university, he started to take part in АСМ contests. Later he realized that he doesn't like how the АСМ contests are organised: the team could only have three members (and he couldn't take all his friends to the competitions and distribute the tasks between the team members efficiently), so he decided to organize his own contests PFAST Inc. — Petr and Friends Are Solving Tasks Corporation. PFAST Inc. rules allow a team to have unlimited number of members.To make this format of contests popular he organised his own tournament. To create the team he will prepare for the contest organised by the PFAST Inc. rules, he chose several volunteers (up to 16 people) and decided to compile a team from them. Petya understands perfectly that if a team has two people that don't get on well, then the team will perform poorly. Put together a team with as many players as possible given that all players should get on well with each other.
2. Input specification: The first line contains two integer numbers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) — the number of volunteers, and m () — the number of pairs that do not get on. Next n lines contain the volunteers' names (each name is a non-empty string consisting of no more than 10 uppercase and/or lowercase Latin letters). Next m lines contain two names — the names of the volunteers who do not get on. The names in pair are separated with a single space. Each pair of volunteers who do not get on occurs exactly once. The strings are case-sensitive. All n names are distinct.
3. Output specification: The first output line should contain the single number k — the number of people in the sought team. Next k lines should contain the names of the sought team's participants in the lexicographical order. If there are several variants to solve the problem, print any of them. Petya might not be a member of the sought team. 
4. Sample inputs: ['3 1\nPetya\nVasya\nMasha\nPetya Vasya', '3 0\nPasha\nLesha\nVanya']
5. Sample outputs: ['2\nMasha\nPetya', '3\nLesha\nPasha\nVanya']
6. Sample explanations: None

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Anna and Maria are in charge of the math club for junior students. When the club gathers together, the students behave badly. They've brought lots of shoe laces to the club and got tied with each other. Specifically, each string ties together two students. Besides, if two students are tied, then the lace connects the first student with the second one as well as the second student with the first one.To restore order, Anna and Maria do the following. First, for each student Anna finds out what other students he is tied to. If a student is tied to exactly one other student, Anna reprimands him. Then Maria gathers in a single group all the students who have been just reprimanded. She kicks them out from the club. This group of students immediately leaves the club. These students takes with them the laces that used to tie them. Then again for every student Anna finds out how many other students he is tied to and so on. And they do so until Anna can reprimand at least one student.Determine how many groups of students will be kicked out of the club.
2. Input specification: The first line contains two integers n and m — the initial number of students and laces (). The students are numbered from 1 to n, and the laces are numbered from 1 to m. Next m lines each contain two integers a and b — the numbers of students tied by the i-th lace (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b). It is guaranteed that no two students are tied with more than one lace. No lace ties a student to himself.
3. Output specification: Print the single number — the number of groups of students that will be kicked out from the club.
4. Sample inputs: ['3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1', '6 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4', '6 5\n1 4\n2 4\n3 4\n5 4\n6 4']
5. Sample outputs: ['0', '2', '1']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first sample Anna and Maria won't kick out any group of students — in the initial position every student is tied to two other students and Anna won't be able to reprimand anyone.In the second sample four students are tied in a chain and two more are running by themselves. First Anna and Maria kick out the two students from both ends of the chain (1 and 4), then — two other students from the chain (2 and 3). At that the students who are running by themselves will stay in the club.In the third sample Anna and Maria will momentarily kick out all students except for the fourth one and the process stops at that point. The correct answer is one.

1. Problem description: A group of n merry programmers celebrate Robert Floyd's birthday. Polucarpus has got an honourable task of pouring Ber-Cola to everybody. Pouring the same amount of Ber-Cola to everybody is really important. In other words, the drink's volume in each of the n mugs must be the same.Polycarpus has already began the process and he partially emptied the Ber-Cola bottle. Now the first mug has a1 milliliters of the drink, the second one has a2 milliliters and so on. The bottle has b milliliters left and Polycarpus plans to pour them into the mugs so that the main equation was fulfilled.Write a program that would determine what volume of the drink Polycarpus needs to add into each mug to ensure that the following two conditions were fulfilled simultaneously:   there were b milliliters poured in total. That is, the bottle need to be emptied;  after the process is over, the volumes of the drink in the mugs should be equal. 
2. Input specification: The first line contains a pair of integers n, b (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ b ≤ 100), where n is the total number of friends in the group and b is the current volume of drink in the bottle. The second line contains a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100), where ai is the current volume of drink in the i-th mug.
3. Output specification: Print a single number "-1" (without the quotes), if there is no solution. Otherwise, print n float numbers c1, c2, ..., cn, where ci is the volume of the drink to add in the i-th mug. Print the numbers with no less than 6 digits after the decimal point, print each ci on a single line. Polycarpus proved that if a solution exists then it is unique. Russian locale is installed by default on the testing computer. Make sure that your solution use the point to separate the integer part of a real number from the decimal, not a comma.
4. Sample inputs: ['5 50\n1 2 3 4 5', '2 2\n1 100']
5. Sample outputs: ['12.000000\n11.000000\n10.000000\n9.000000\n8.000000', '-1']

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: Dwarfs have planted a very interesting plant, which is a triangle directed "upwards". This plant has an amusing feature. After one year a triangle plant directed "upwards" divides into four triangle plants: three of them will point "upwards" and one will point "downwards". After another year, each triangle plant divides into four triangle plants: three of them will be directed in the same direction as the parent plant, and one of them will be directed in the opposite direction. Then each year the process repeats. The figure below illustrates this process.  Help the dwarfs find out how many triangle plants that point "upwards" will be in n years.
2. Input specification: The first line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of full years when the plant grew. Please do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.
3. Output specification: Print a single integer — the remainder of dividing the number of plants that will point "upwards" in n years by 1000000007 (109 + 7).
4. Sample inputs: ['1', '2']
5. Sample outputs: ['3', '10']
6. Sample explanations: NoteThe first test sample corresponds to the second triangle on the figure in the statement. The second test sample corresponds to the third one.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: In Berland the opposition is going to arrange mass walking on the boulevard. The boulevard consists of n tiles that are lain in a row and are numbered from 1 to n from right to left. The opposition should start walking on the tile number 1 and the finish on the tile number n. During the walk it is allowed to move from right to left between adjacent tiles in a row, and jump over a tile. More formally, if you are standing on the tile number i (i &lt; n - 1), you can reach the tiles number i + 1 or the tile number i + 2 from it (if you stand on the tile number n - 1, you can only reach tile number n). We can assume that all the opposition movements occur instantaneously.In order to thwart an opposition rally, the Berland bloody regime organized the rain. The tiles on the boulevard are of poor quality and they are rapidly destroyed in the rain. We know that the i-th tile is destroyed after ai days of rain (on day ai tile isn't destroyed yet, and on day ai + 1 it is already destroyed). Of course, no one is allowed to walk on the destroyed tiles! So the walk of the opposition is considered thwarted, if either the tile number 1 is broken, or the tile number n is broken, or it is impossible to reach the tile number n from the tile number 1 if we can walk on undestroyed tiles.The opposition wants to gather more supporters for their walk. Therefore, the more time they have to pack, the better. Help the opposition to calculate how much time they still have and tell us for how many days the walk from the tile number 1 to the tile number n will be possible.
2. Input specification: The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 103) — the boulevard's length in tiles. The second line contains n space-separated integers ai — the number of days after which the i-th tile gets destroyed (1 ≤ ai ≤ 103). 
3. Output specification: Print a single number — the sought number of days.
4. Sample inputs: ['4\n10 3 5 10', '5\n10 2 8 3 5']
5. Sample outputs: ['5', '5']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first sample the second tile gets destroyed after day three, and the only path left is 1 → 3 → 4. After day five there is a two-tile gap between the first and the last tile, you can't jump over it.In the second sample path 1 → 3 → 5 is available up to day five, inclusive. On day six the last tile is destroyed and the walk is thwarted.

1. Problem description: The Little Elephant loves to play with color cards.He has n cards, each has exactly two colors (the color of the front side and the color of the back side).

The Little Elephant thinks that a set of cards on the table is funny if at least half of the cards have the same color (for each card the color of the upper side is considered).Help the Little Elephant to find the minimum number of moves needed to make the set of n cards funny.
2. Input specification: The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of the cards. The following n lines contain the description of all cards, one card per line. The cards are described by a pair of positive integers not exceeding 109 — colors of both sides. The first number in a line is the color of the front of the card, the second one — of the back. The color of the front of the card may coincide with the color of the back of the card. The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.
3. Output specification: On a single line print a single integer — the sought minimum number of moves. If it is impossible to make the set funny, print -1.
4. Sample inputs: ['3\n4 7\n4 7\n7 4', '5\n4 7\n7 4\n2 11\n9 7\n1 1']
5. Sample outputs: ['0', '2']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first sample there initially are three cards lying with colors 4, 4, 7. Since two of the three cards are of the same color 4, you do not need to change anything, so the answer is 0.In the second sample, you can turn the first and the fourth cards. After that three of the five cards will be of color 7.

1. Problem description: Vasya, like many others, likes to participate in a variety of sweepstakes and lotteries. Now he collects wrappings from a famous chocolate bar "Jupiter". According to the sweepstake rules, each wrapping has an integer written on it — the number of points that the participant adds to his score as he buys the bar. After a participant earns a certain number of points, he can come to the prize distribution center and exchange the points for prizes. When somebody takes a prize, the prize's cost is simply subtracted from the number of his points.Vasya didn't only bought the bars, he also kept a record of how many points each wrapping cost. Also, he remembers that he always stucks to the greedy strategy — as soon as he could take at least one prize, he went to the prize distribution centre and exchanged the points for prizes. Moreover, if he could choose between multiple prizes, he chose the most expensive one. If after an exchange Vasya had enough points left to get at least one more prize, then he continued to exchange points.The sweepstake has the following prizes (the prizes are sorted by increasing of their cost):   a mug (costs a points),  a towel (costs b points),  a bag (costs c points),  a bicycle (costs d points),  a car (costs e points). Now Vasya wants to recollect what prizes he has received. You know sequence p1, p2, ..., pn, where pi is the number of points Vasya got for the i-th bar. The sequence of points is given in the chronological order. You also know numbers a, b, c, d, e. Your task is to find, how many prizes Vasya received, what prizes they are and how many points he's got left after all operations are completed.
2. Input specification: The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of chocolate bar wrappings that brought points to Vasya. The second line contains space-separated integers p1, p2, ..., pn (1 ≤ pi ≤ 109). The third line contains 5 integers a, b, c, d, e (1 ≤ a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; d &lt; e ≤ 109) — the prizes' costs.
3. Output specification: Print on the first line 5 integers, separated by a space — the number of mugs, towels, bags, bicycles and cars that Vasya has got, respectively. On the second line print a single integer — the number of points Vasya will have left after all operations of exchange are completed. Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.
4. Sample inputs: ['3\n3 10 4\n2 4 10 15 20', '4\n10 4 39 2\n3 5 10 11 12']
5. Sample outputs: ['1 1 1 0 0 \n1', '3 0 1 0 3 \n0']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first sample Vasya gets 3 points after eating the first chocolate bar. Then he exchanges 2 points and gets a mug. Vasya wins a bag after eating the second chocolate bar. Then he wins a towel after eating the third chocolate bar. After all chocolate bars 3 - 2 + 10 - 10 + 4 - 4 = 1 points remains.

1. Problem description: Vasya's bicycle chain drive consists of two parts: n stars are attached to the pedal axle, m stars are attached to the rear wheel axle. The chain helps to rotate the rear wheel by transmitting the pedal rotation.We know that the i-th star on the pedal axle has ai (0 &lt; a1 &lt; a2 &lt; ... &lt; an) teeth, and the j-th star on the rear wheel axle has bj (0 &lt; b1 &lt; b2 &lt; ... &lt; bm) teeth. Any pair (i, j) (1 ≤ i ≤ n; 1 ≤ j ≤ m) is called a gear and sets the indexes of stars to which the chain is currently attached. Gear (i, j) has a gear ratio, equal to the value .Since Vasya likes integers, he wants to find such gears (i, j), that their ratios are integers. On the other hand, Vasya likes fast driving, so among all "integer" gears (i, j) he wants to choose a gear with the maximum ratio. Help him to find the number of such gears.In the problem, fraction  denotes division in real numbers, that is, no rounding is performed.
2. Input specification: The first input line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of stars on the bicycle's pedal axle. The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 104) in the order of strict increasing. The third input line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 50) — the number of stars on the rear wheel axle. The fourth line contains m integers b1, b2, ..., bm (1 ≤ bi ≤ 104) in the order of strict increasing. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one gear (i, j), that its gear ratio is an integer. The numbers on the lines are separated by spaces.
3. Output specification: Print the number of "integer" gears with the maximum ratio among all "integer" gears.
4. Sample inputs: ['2\n4 5\n3\n12 13 15', '4\n1 2 3 4\n5\n10 11 12 13 14']
5. Sample outputs: ['2', '1']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first sample the maximum "integer" gear ratio equals 3. There are two gears that have such gear ratio. For one of them a1 = 4, b1 = 12, and for the other a2 = 5, b3 = 15.

1. Problem description: Bajtek is learning to skate on ice. He's a beginner, so his only mode of transportation is pushing off from a snow drift to the north, east, south or west and sliding until he lands in another snow drift. He has noticed that in this way it's impossible to get from some snow drifts to some other by any sequence of moves. He now wants to heap up some additional snow drifts, so that he can get from any snow drift to any other one. He asked you to find the minimal number of snow drifts that need to be created.We assume that Bajtek can only heap up snow drifts at integer coordinates.
2. Input specification: The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of snow drifts. Each of the following n lines contains two integers xi and yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000) — the coordinates of the i-th snow drift. Note that the north direction coinсides with the direction of Oy axis, so the east direction coinсides with the direction of the Ox axis. All snow drift's locations are distinct.
3. Output specification: Output the minimal number of snow drifts that need to be created in order for Bajtek to be able to reach any snow drift from any other one.
4. Sample inputs: ['2\n2 1\n1 2', '2\n2 1\n4 1']

1. Problem description: Peter likes to travel by train. He likes it so much that on the train he falls asleep. Once in summer Peter was going by train from city A to city B, and as usual, was sleeping. Then he woke up, started to look through the window and noticed that every railway station has a flag of a particular colour.The boy started to memorize the order of the flags' colours that he had seen. But soon he fell asleep again. Unfortunately, he didn't sleep long, he woke up and went on memorizing the colours. Then he fell asleep again, and that time he slept till the end of the journey.At the station he told his parents about what he was doing, and wrote two sequences of the colours that he had seen before and after his sleep, respectively.Peter's parents know that their son likes to fantasize. They give you the list of the flags' colours at the stations that the train passes sequentially on the way from A to B, and ask you to find out if Peter could see those sequences on the way from A to B, or from B to A. Remember, please, that Peter had two periods of wakefulness.Peter's parents put lowercase Latin letters for colours. The same letter stands for the same colour, different letters — for different colours.
2. Input specification: The input data contains three lines. The first line contains a non-empty string, whose length does not exceed 105, the string consists of lowercase Latin letters — the flags' colours at the stations on the way from A to B. On the way from B to A the train passes the same stations, but in reverse order.  The second line contains the sequence, written by Peter during the first period of wakefulness. The third line contains the sequence, written during the second period of wakefulness. Both sequences are non-empty, consist of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of each does not exceed 100 letters. Each of the sequences is written in chronological order. 
3. Output specification: Output one of the four words without inverted commas:    «forward» — if Peter could see such sequences only on the way from A to B;  «backward» — if Peter could see such sequences on the way from B to A;  «both» — if Peter could see such sequences both on the way from A to B, and on the way from B to A;  «fantasy» — if Peter could not see such sequences. 
4. Sample inputs: ['atob\na\nb', 'aaacaaa\naca\naa']
5. Sample outputs: ['forward', 'both']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIt is assumed that the train moves all the time, so one flag cannot be seen twice. There are no flags at stations A and B.

1. Problem description: And again a misfortune fell on Poor Student. He is being late for an exam.Having rushed to a bus stop that is in point (0, 0), he got on a minibus and they drove along a straight line, parallel to axis OX, in the direction of increasing x.Poor Student knows the following:   during one run the minibus makes n stops, the i-th stop is in point (xi, 0)  coordinates of all the stops are different  the minibus drives at a constant speed, equal to vb  it can be assumed the passengers get on and off the minibus at a bus stop momentarily  Student can get off the minibus only at a bus stop  Student will have to get off the minibus at a terminal stop, if he does not get off earlier  the University, where the exam will be held, is in point (xu, yu)  Student can run from a bus stop to the University at a constant speed vs as long as needed  a distance between two points can be calculated according to the following formula:   Student is already on the minibus, so, he cannot get off at the first bus stop Poor Student wants to get to the University as soon as possible. Help him to choose the bus stop, where he should get off. If such bus stops are multiple, choose the bus stop closest to the University.
2. Input specification: The first line contains three integer numbers: 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ vb, vs ≤ 1000. The second line contains n non-negative integers in ascending order: coordinates xi of the bus stop with index i. It is guaranteed that x1 equals to zero, and xn ≤ 105. The third line contains the coordinates of the University, integers xu and yu, not exceeding 105 in absolute value. 
3. Output specification: In the only line output the answer to the problem — index of the optimum bus stop.
4. Sample inputs: ['4 5 2\n0 2 4 6\n4 1', '2 1 1\n0 100000\n100000 100000']
5. Sample outputs: ['3', '2']
6. Sample explanations: NoteAs you know, students are a special sort of people, and minibuses usually do not hurry. That's why you should not be surprised, if Student's speed is higher than the speed of the minibus.

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: A new cottage village called «Flatville» is being built in Flatland. By now they have already built in «Flatville» n square houses with the centres on the Оx-axis. The houses' sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. It's known that no two houses overlap, but they can touch each other.The architect bureau, where Peter works, was commissioned to build a new house in «Flatville». The customer wants his future house to be on the Оx-axis, to be square in shape, have a side t, and touch at least one of the already built houses. For sure, its sides should be parallel to the coordinate axes, its centre should be on the Ox-axis and it shouldn't overlap any of the houses in the village.Peter was given a list of all the houses in «Flatville». Would you help him find the amount of possible positions of the new house?
2. Input specification: The first line of the input data contains numbers n and t (1 ≤ n, t ≤ 1000). Then there follow n lines, each of them contains two space-separated integer numbers: xi ai, where xi — x-coordinate of the centre of the i-th house, and ai — length of its side ( - 1000 ≤ xi ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000).
3. Output specification: Output the amount of possible positions of the new house.
4. Sample inputs: ['2 2\n0 4\n6 2', '2 2\n0 4\n5 2', '2 3\n0 4\n5 2']
5. Sample outputs: ['4', '3', '2']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIt is possible for the x-coordinate of the new house to have non-integer value.

1. Problem description: A long time ago in some far country lived king Copa. After the recent king's reform, he got so large powers that started to keep the books by himself.The total income A of his kingdom during 0-th year is known, as well as the total income B during n-th year (these numbers can be negative — it means that there was a loss in the correspondent year). King wants to show financial stability. To do this, he needs to find common coefficient X — the coefficient of income growth during one year. This coefficient should satisfy the equation:A·Xn = B.Surely, the king is not going to do this job by himself, and demands you to find such number X.It is necessary to point out that the fractional numbers are not used in kingdom's economy. That's why all input numbers as well as coefficient X must be integers. The number X may be zero or negative.
2. Input specification: The input contains three integers A, B, n (|A|, |B| ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10).
3. Output specification: Output the required integer coefficient X, or «No solution», if such a coefficient does not exist or it is fractional. If there are several possible solutions, output any of them.
4. Sample inputs: ['2 18 2', '-1 8 3', '0 0 10', '1 16 5']

As a professional code developer with years of experience, please provide the corresponding code solution based on the problem description. Detailed information is given below:
1. Problem description: In a strategic computer game "Settlers II" one has to build defense structures to expand and protect the territory. Let's take one of these buildings. At the moment the defense structure accommodates exactly n soldiers. Within this task we can assume that the number of soldiers in the defense structure won't either increase or decrease.Every soldier has a rank — some natural number from 1 to k. 1 stands for a private and k stands for a general. The higher the rank of the soldier is, the better he fights. Therefore, the player profits from having the soldiers of the highest possible rank.To increase the ranks of soldiers they need to train. But the soldiers won't train for free, and each training session requires one golden coin. On each training session all the n soldiers are present.At the end of each training session the soldiers' ranks increase as follows. First all the soldiers are divided into groups with the same rank, so that the least possible number of groups is formed. Then, within each of the groups where the soldiers below the rank k are present, exactly one soldier increases his rank by one.You know the ranks of all n soldiers at the moment. Determine the number of golden coins that are needed to increase the ranks of all the soldiers to the rank k.
2. Input specification: The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100). They represent the number of soldiers and the number of different ranks correspondingly. The second line contains n numbers in the non-decreasing order. The i-th of them, ai, represents the rank of the i-th soldier in the defense building (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ k).
3. Output specification: Print a single integer — the number of golden coins needed to raise all the soldiers to the maximal rank.
4. Sample inputs: ['4 4\n1 2 2 3', '4 3\n1 1 1 1']
5. Sample outputs: ['4', '5']
6. Sample explanations: NoteIn the first example the ranks will be raised in the following manner:1 2 2 3  →  2 2 3 4  →  2 3 4 4  →  3 4 4 4  →  4 4 4 4Thus totals to 4 training sessions that require 4 golden coins.
7. Programming language: python
8. support programming language version: ['python2', 'python3']
Please take care to minimize the use of complex header files.
